Never see either of them again,5607,"Your life is what you make of it - and here you are with a clean slate (under unfortunate circumstances) to do just that. Make something of this. Cut them out of your life. I know people say forgive, love, etc but HELL no - this isn’t a forgivable act. Your sister is having your husband’s baby. Period. Cut them out of your life. Google jobs further away maybe, google vacations where you can get work visas, make a change and show you’re unstoppable. Take time to heal without having to go to family events in the mean time and see either of them. Frankly, if I were either of your parents, I wouldn’t make them welcome at anything planned.

0,7617,"Dear Reddit friends 
I met with my friend, I talk to her and explained the whole ordeal, she was actually happy that I reached out to her, she knows how much I hate cheaters, when I was a child I walked in on my Dad cheating on my Mom with the help. 
I apologized to my friend and I made her listen to the whatsapp messages, she was really sad that I would think for a second that she would be capable of sleeping with my husband but as I said, she understood my anger and mistrust.
She told me that she actually had sex with my brother in law a few times and even the night before he got married they were together until 7, I know she's not lying because my in laws could not locate him till 7:30 am and everyone was worried that he would be a no show that day.
I apologized to my friend, and then I called my in laws  to explain to them that I will never speak to their son ever again, I'm not giving him a second chance to ever hurt me, I don't care if he goes from being a druggie to becoming a preacher, he made me think the worse of my husband and hurt my family.
I don't think that my husband is a saint but he really has put his family first as he pointed out.
As for my sister in law, I'm done with her too because in the messages she's heard laughing in the background, I will not tell her about his infidelity because she made her bed she can lay in it, and I don't want to hurt her the way I was hurt today.
As for my husband, I'm in the kitchen as I write this preparing his favorite meal and I will apologize to him for being so rude and disrespectful, he and our daughter are the best things in my life.
Sorry for the long post, thanks for listening, since I've found Reddit 6 months ago I really do enjoy people and their different points of views. Thanks again and Happy New Year.
",7618,This is great news! Never speak to the scum again and focus on your family - congratulations x,7623,"Your friend's story sounds like total bullshit.  She was hurt she was considered the type of person who would sleep with a married man, especially your husband, but when confronted suddenly she admits to sleeping with a married man, and doing the day before his wedding, and that married man was until today someone who was a part of your family????  Even by the actions she admitted to, this person is not your friend. Out of everyone in this story, the least trustworthy person is not the brother-in-law, but your ""friend"".  Drop the brother-in-law if you want, he seems like a dick. Drop your husband if you don’t believe him.  But whatever you do drop this friend first.",7626,I don’t know. Would you REALLY believe a friend that slept with your brother in law and stayed with him until 7 am of the morning he was getting married? Something doesn’t seem right. Your friend still isn’t a good person. ,7627,What do you think of your friend's characters now that you know she cheated with a man on his wedding day? ,7628,"I sincerely hope she is telling you the truth. However, listen to your gut if you’re at all unsure. It’s doubtful your friend or husband would come clean when it can easily be explained away as the drunk brother being a jerk. Also seems odd to me you’re just hearing from her that she was sleeping with your BIL. Again, I truly hope you’ve gotten the full true story but I know from personal experience not to accept it as the truth when you’re gut is screaming at you that somethings aren’t adding up. It’s an even worse feeling to find out you’ve been betrayed and lied to more than once.",7629,Wow your friend is not a good person :(,7630,"Thank you for the follow up! I was happy to read that because I was sincerely sad when I read the original post.

It makes it harder on families, but keeping him in your life sounds like it will make your family worse.",7633,"I'd like to be happy for you, but just one party's denial doesn't necessarily confirm or disprove anything. I want to suggest that you mention what your BIL did, but I also don't really know the best way to go about that.

I say live with the reality you're currently projecting and believing and remain with him.",7635,"I'm so glad it all worked out! Well done for going no contact with brother and sister in law.

0,14323,"Not to scare anyone from doing it, but my experience with the hotline was horrific. 

I called, and they didn’t provide me any support over the phone. They made me give them my address before they could speak with me. I reiterated several times that i was uncomfortable with that, but the man said he needed to know I’m at a safe location, blah blah. I was too mentally distraught to continue arguing, so i gave it to him. After giving my reasons and trying to explain myself, he insisted i was “refusing help” and offered to send an ambulance to come get me. I don’t have health insurance, so i declined. He told me to drive myself to the ER and they’ll call to ensure i got there; if i didn’t, they would send an ambulance and/or police to my house. I was terrified and it seemed i had no other option, so i went. To be clear, my conversation with this man lasted less than five minutes. 

Can i mention it’s a pretty shitty move to back an admittedly suicidal person into a corner?

The hospital involuntarily admitted me for six days because I had called the hotline and didn’t want to be put on an antidepressant regimen. It was supposed to be overnight, but i went in on a Friday, doc wasn’t in until Monday, then wouldn’t release me without “observing” me for a few. During that time, we had bullshit group sessions that were half-assed and only seemed to occur to fulfill some kind of obligation on the hospitals part. I got no therapy, no counseling, no one discussed why I called or felt that way, unless it was the doctor pushing me to go on antidepressants. 

It was a riveting experience, and absolutely broke me down further than I was before. I missed work inexplicably and was unable to call out because they took my phone upon arrival; due to the stigma of being committed, I was unable to explain my reasoning - resulting in termination. My boyfriend left me because he said I was “unstable” (turned out to be a blessing in disguise, but still awful at the time). My family all hovered over me for months to come, which made me feel like I was suffocating. 

Again, I’m not saying the hotline can’t help. I just plead that others take another course of action if AT ALL possible before resorting to that, because my experience landed me in a much more devastating place than I was when I had called. 

EDIT: I had no idea this would spark such a conversation, but I’m happy i was able to share and allow others to. I’ll try to respond to everyone as I can, but !!please!! feel free to PM me if any of you need someone to talk to. ",14371,"The biggest irony of everyone sharing hotline numbers is that people are talking about hotlines calling ambulances on suicidal callers and like...I sympathize, that the point of a suicide hotline is to prevent suicide and as nothing more than a voice they have very little power and sometimes need to send someone physically able to prevent the suicide.

But like - as someone who is deathly terrified of incurring medical bills, I'm now sure to basically never call a suicide hotline. I don't even care if they can be helpful or if most of the time they are helpful. Just knowing that getting an ambulance called on me is a *possibility* is exactly the reason I'm never calling one.",14381,"This is horrible! This is my absolute worst nightmare (being locked up) and this is why I don't go for help, or call hotlines. I was close to calling a hotline a few times, but luckily I looked it up online first, because I was concerned, and I found out that, like you said, they can and do trace you, so I didn't call. Your story is the reason why, that is terrifying! How horrible is it that you call looking for help and they treat you like that? That is criminal! To bully you into giving out your address, and then bully you into giving up your freedom, and then bully you more into taking drugs??? No way that is happening to me, I'll just sort out my own problems.

The ironic thing is that by forcing people to get ""help"" (by locking them up) they are turning people away from seeking help in the first place.",14393,"A social worker, after that I have half a mind to call myself just to see how I'm treated. I want to know what I'm sending clients to and it's been a bit since I checked in on this stuff.",14395,"I had a similar experience to yours. I never called the hotline but after informing my therapist she was aware of my ideations.  Eventually something happened and I did one of those classic grabs for attention on Facebook. My friends came over at 1 am and they convinced me to go to the hospital and voluntarily commit myself.  Needless to say that 2 day experience opened my eyes to basically never admit you have ideations if you do. That experience single handledly made me stop medication and therapy for 4 years because I didn't want to go back to that world.  I didn't want to take 5 medications a day to just function barely. Therapy was at the time just college therapy but the multiple therapists tried to do CBT. One even suggested ECT on me because it may help. I wasn't really into that. 

Anyway being in that psych ward made me fearful of doctors and therapists who would forcefully commute you. Similar to op's story, they didn't let me out until it was 48 hours after ""examining"" me. Forcefully commited people requirsmed 72 hours I think.  As soon as you enter they take everything that you could use harm yourself. No belt no shoe laces etc. You start looking for ways to escape or items to hurt yourself in protest to how they treat you. Honestly most of the time I just slept in my bed. Overall I wouldn't wish that experience on anyone. ",14398,I can relate. Had the same experience when I called once. I felt backed into a corner. I didn't want to give my address and I kept avoiding that question. I didn't talk about my feelings when I called and no one asked about how or why I was feeling those feelings other than to confirm I felt suicidal at that time. THERE MAY AS WELL HAVE A BEEN A ROBOT ON THE PHONE WITH ME. THATS THE IMPRESSION I GOT WHEN I CALLED. NO COMPASSION. NO REAL HUMAN INTERACTION.,14404,A loved one was involuntarily committed. Then released when they realized they weren't supposed to be there. It just taught us not to seek help.,14407,"This experience is so similar to mine it’s eerie. I would never ever tell anyone to call one of these numbers, and if you do, use careful wording to avoid being on a 72-hour hold. I’ll have to dig up the stat but I think quite a few people re-attempt suicide after being in a psychiatric facility. My experience made me understand why. It cost me time, money, in some cases like with Work or a living situation I had no better alternatives than sharing the truth about where I was when I was on an involuntary hold. It was awful.  

Thank you for sharing your experience, and I’m here if you ever want to talk. ",14408,Damn I'm so sorry. I had a bad experience calling but it was more that the guy made me feel worse and angry. He sounded like he was belittling me or making me feel bad but I didn't think they could be as bad as what they did to you. So sorry :( I'm glad you seem to be doing better now though,14410,Damn. My heart ❤️ broke reading this. Do they ask for an address whenever someone calls the hotline?  I always assumed there’d be a really caring person on the other end to talk things thru. I never really thought about them wanting an address first. ,14412,They are useless.,14413,"That is unbelievably messed up. That's sounds horrifying, it reads like 1984-esque fiction. I hope you have healed some since then and are doing well. I feel terrible knowing that happened to you."
0,54327,"Congrats man! I am a dad to a little girl and it's amazing. Be everything you can be for her. People say ""oh better get the gun out to fend off those boys later."" I don't like that. I hope your daughter loves you so much that any young man who fails to be like you, she won't even show interest in. 

I'm happy for you, enjoy the whole experience. Having a child is truly incredible.",54328,"This 100%. Coming from a woman whose dad said that as a little girl...everything was kept a secret from my dad. You do NOT want that. 

Also...be there for her all you can. I know this sounds obvious, but my dad missed most of my band concerts and track meets. When I was on homecoming court and the dads escorted their daughters to the football field for part of the homecoming parade, he did nothing but bitch about “having to be there” the entire time. I’m in my 30s and these are the memories that have stuck with me. ",54345,"I'd like to add, I've noticed that some dudes are disappointed about having daughters (which makes me sad for them and their kids) because they think they can't do any of their favorite stereotypically masculine activities with them (play sports, go fishing, etc.). 

I took after my father in many ways (good and bad), while my brother took after my mother. My brother has absolutely no interest in the ""manly"" hobbies my dad has. Growing up in the south, he was teased quite a lot over it by his peers and even adults (kids called him a ""fag"" or a ""queer"" and adults would just hint, not so subtly, that something ""ain't quite right"" with a boy who doesn't like sports). 

Dad is a blue collar guy and your typical southern ""good ol' boy."" He is not the easiest person to get along with, but to his credit, he never pressured my brother to become someone he is not. 

Whenever he wants to talk about cars, knives, guns, mechanics, etc., he comes to me because he knows I also enjoy those topics, while they bore my brother to tears. We work on cars and appliances together. 

My brother has plenty of skill in the areas that interest him (he likes voice acting, writing, community theater, video games, politics), but he couldn't change the oil in his car to save his life. 

I think there's a lot to be said for raising boys and girls the same way. You never know who's going to have a talent or affinity for a subject until they're made familiar with it.

One last note on that topic (and sorry for rambling!): It is really important for kids--but maybe especially girls--to feel like they're good at something. Growing up, I noticed so many outspoken, rambunctious little girls grow into self-conscious teens with poor self-esteem, and so many of them were preyed upon by loser boyfriends who took advantage of their vulnerability and became controlling or abusive. If you give a kid reason to be proud and confident (let them play a sport they like, give them martial arts training, teach them to play an instrument, and so on, and be generous with words of praise), they won't necessarily be immune to predators, but they'll definitely be less vulnerable.",54352,"It's the perfect way to think of it. My brother has always been a bit of a hoodlum growing up but when he got children he tried to grow up. I still remind him that the way my parents raised me (crazy mom) I would so much rather lie to her than deal with her. I remind him that unless he wants her to hide from him he needs to be open with her. Following that he is her representative of the type of guy she will find because she sees the way he treats her mom as the standard. I try to get him to imagine her finding someone just like him, would he be happy if she found someone like him? If the answer is no he needs to change the things about himself that make him feel that way so she has a higher standard.",54353,"Also, realistically who wants to be a parent to a lonely adult child because everyone is terrified of their gun-toting dad? We don't have so much of an issue with that in the UK but I know plenty of mum's who swear that their son is never leaving home. It all just seems a bit weird and creepy to me.",54354,Not to mention it implies boys can't keep it in their pants and girls aren't autonomous enough to decide when to have sex. You have a great attitude towards being a daddy!,54355,"I'm a dad to a little girl as well and this is all I've had since we were even telling people. Bugs the hell out of me. Love that little monkey so much, I'd hate to be seen like that by her.",54356,"If she ends up being interested in guys in the first place, that is. ",54359,"Right. We're too comfortable with guns in the US. What you need is a moat and a knight clad in black armor. Thatll put the fear in those hairy legged, hormone crazed flesh bags.",54360,As the daughter of an amazing incredible father he never did that crap with me either.

I've always wanted to write a story. I have another unfinished screenplay called Seven Days in LA that I would love to work on, but I find it difficult to motivate with all the moving pieces of my day-to-day.

Ninja edit: if you're curious for more, [I did write this about the day](https://reddit.com/r/AskReddit/comments/85rryv/only_children_of_reddit_what_is_something_that/dvzxio6/) her and I split. Might offer some perspective and something more to read. ",55115,I was thinking the same thing about your writing. You do an excellent job of painting a picture for your readers. I could feel your excitement at being free. Really enjoyed reading it :),55116,"What’s good about it is you say a thousand things in just a few words. The best writing is done when thoughts and emotions are expressed through actions. 

Instead of saying, “I was a broken man,” you paint a picture for us of what a broken man does, and how those actions are motivated. ",55121,"It reads like the inner monologue/voiceover of a film noir detective, only not so gravelly. It's smooth, but sharp. The short punctuated sentence structure paints a picture about how your thoughts and actions seem to have played out.

 If it were a movie, there would be very short lived shots of a phone ringing, a few words spoken and the phone being loudly hung up. The car trunk would open, a few things would go in, the trunk would appear full in the next shot, and the trunk would pleasantly slam shut. Very concise. 

I hope this makes sense. It's hard to describe what made your working so enjoyable. ",55126,"I can get behind that comment as well. You write in a ""voice"" very similar to my own. It all read as if I'd said it. It made the whole story flow very well.

0,55550,This is why my husband and I eloped! ,55551,"My husband and I tried to elope but I felt the need to tell my mom beforehand. Being the youngest in the family and the only girl, I knew she'd flip if we eloped. But with both of us having student loan debt (and I'm still in graduate school, and he wants to go back to school), and having just bought a house, we didn't want to spend the money to have a big fancy wedding. Especially because we're located in Florida, his family is in Chicago and mine in California. Too much money would be spent on travel for a one-day affair.

We compromised with my mom. She said her biggest request is that my dad would be able to walk me down the aisle. We decided to have a tiny parents-only wedding. No siblings. Just the two of us and our moms and dads. I found a beautiful little gazebo in the middle of a botanical garden. I found my dress on Etsy for $25 and it was absolutely gorgeous and fit my personality perfectly. My mom paid for my hair and makeup to get done the morning of and she paid for a photographer. We had my old regulars from when I used to bartend marry us because they are my ""Florida parents"" and she's an officiant. One of my husband's friends has played violin her whole life so she came to play a song as I walked down the aisle with my dad. The entire thing was very simple and very beautiful. We took pictures all around the gardens with our photographer and then we went to Epcot and drank around the world, where I promptly spilled beer all over the front of my wedding dress. But hey, it was only $25, so who cares?

Overall, the entire wedding was less than $800 and my mom paid for everything. We had three receptions, one in Florida, one in Chicago, and one in California so that our families wouldn't have to spend hundreds to come to Florida. It was so much less stress. And I loved that the receptions were smaller groups of people because I don't do  well in large groups. And it turned out that more people were able to attend the receptions because they didn't have to travel as far or make hotel arrangements! We found super cheap roundtrip flights ($385 each) to Norway, so that's where we took our honeymoon and spent a week hiking and enjoying nature. I wouldn't change a thing about our sorta-elopement. It was perfect.

OP, good luck! I got very annoyed with the ""don't do it, it's a trap"" comments too after we got engaged.

But with both of us having student loan debt (and I'm still in graduate school, and he wants to go back to school), and having just bought a house, we didn't want to spend the money to have a big fancy wedding. Especially because we're located in Florida, his family is in Chicago and mine in California. Too much money would be spent on travel for a one-day affair.

We compromised with my mom. She said her biggest request is that my dad would be able to walk me down the aisle. We decided to have a tiny parents-only wedding. No siblings. Just the two of us and our moms and dads. I found a beautiful little gazebo in the middle of a botanical garden. I found my dress on Etsy for $25 and it was absolutely gorgeous and fit my personality perfectly. My mom paid for my hair and makeup to get done the morning of and she paid for a photographer. We had my old regulars from when I used to bartend marry us because they are my ""Florida parents"" and she's an officiant. One of my husband's friends has played violin her whole life so she came to play a song as I walked down the aisle with my dad. The entire thing was very simple and very beautiful. We took pictures all around the gardens with our photographer and then we went to Epcot and drank around the world, where I promptly spilled beer all over the front of my wedding dress. But hey, it was only $25, so who cares?

Overall, the entire wedding was less than $800 and my mom paid for everything. We had three receptions, one in Florida, one in Chicago, and one in California so that our families wouldn't have to spend hundreds to come to Florida. It was so much less stress. And I loved that the receptions were smaller groups of people because I don't do  well in large groups. And it turned out that more people were able to attend the receptions because they didn't have to travel as far or make hotel arrangements! We found super cheap roundtrip flights ($385 each) to Norway, so that's where we took our honeymoon and spent a week hiking and enjoying nature. I wouldn't change a thing about our sorta-elopement. It was perfect.

0,56600,"I went to try a CPAP machine after one of my previous girlfriends was scared I was dying in the night. Not breathing for 30 seconds to a minute sporadically through the night tends to unnerve the ones sleeping next to you.

I tried it for a bit, but I kept tearing off the mask in my sleep. I'm jealous you are able to sleep with it on, but it might be because I'm a side sleeper, although you make a good point about not being able to breathe on your back.

Maybe I should try one again...

Edit: wow, I'm overwhelmed with the responses. Thank you to everyone who has given me advice! I'll be going to my doctor about looking into an oral appliance.

Thank you again!",56601,I was worried about tearing the mask off in the night as well. I kept it on last night so hopefully it won't be an issue. They make a few different style masks you could try.

My then boyfriend now hubby had horrible sleep apnea and raised the roof with his snoring.  Additionally he was falling asleep at work and at the wheel of his car on the road.

After a few months he can sleep straight through the night without my physical ""reminders"".  ",56620,"So, I didn't have a problem tearing it off in my sleep, at first.  I just... couldn't sleep.  They had the pressure set to 10 (no idea what units that's just what the machine was set to, sorry) and it was like I was trying to breath out into a tire pump lol.  The mask was comfortable otherwise but I found it so much harder to breathe that I'd eventually just give up.

They prescribed me sleeping pills at that point, and wow, those pills WORK.  Put the mask on, take the pill, BAM, asleep in 5 minutes.

But I woke up every morning to find my mask AND CPAP machine in a whole different position as if I pulled the mask off and THREW it as hard as I can.  I can't remember doing it but that's what would happen.

Ultimately just went back to au natural.  I never have felt particularly tired in the mornings though.  But my docs did say it was the worst case of apnea they had seen, something like a 60% reduction in oxygen or something, so yay!",56632,I do customer service for a respiratory company and you wouldn’t believe how many people call in with the same complaint try using it at night before going to bed while reading or watching tv it helps you get used to it while your awake.

There are literally hundreds out there and sometimes it takes a few tries to find the right one! ,56635," In order to get past exactly that, I would trick myself. I would go to bed, and set an alarm on my phone for an hour later, knowing that I was so exhausted all the time that I would fall asleep right away. When my alarm went off after an hour I would wake up just long enough to put the mask on and then go back to sleep, to be awakened at the right time by my other alarm so I could get up and go to work. That worked for about a month, and ever since then I have not needed to do it anymore.

 It is totally possible to adapt to the mask. The annoying phase of ripping it off in the night is just another thing to push through. You got this.",56641,"You could try other mask. Heated tubes, etc sometimes it's just finding the right setup. Plus even if you tear it off after 4 hours, thats 4 hours of sleep you benefitted with it on.",56642,"Try the ""nasal pillows"".

The time I tried to learn how to say ""Congratulations"" in Hindi to talk to a friend's boyfriend, I apparently both butchered the pronunciation and misjudged -- while he's Indian, Hindi isn't his native tongue.",64404,"I had an awkward conversation once where I tried to practice my Mandarin Chinese on this girl from Hong Kong. In my defence she told me she was Chinese, so it wasn't a terrible assumption to make. :)",64464,"Most people have been talking about the regional languages in India, and that's all relevant, but what a lot of people haven't mentioned is that not only are there dozens and hundreds of languages, but there are two major language families in India.

One of them is the Indo-European family, Hindi, Punjabi, Gujarati, Sindhi and Bengali being the most well-known of these (Urdu also belongs to this family, but Pakistanis often don't like the idea of speaking a language in a family that's named ""Indo-"" anything, so shhhhh).  English is in this family, too, but I'll get to that momentarily.  The other are the Dravidian languages, which are completely, totally, hugely different.  Kannada, Telugu, Tamil, and Malayam are the most widespread ones.

The Dravidian languages are more different from the Indo-European languages than Hindi is from English.  Not even kidding.  Hindi and English share a well-documented genetic relationship to each other, but neither one is at all related to the Dravidian languages.

There's a lot of cross-pollination between the two major language families in India, because they've coexisted for several thousand years, but that doesn't change that they are fundamentally different, and in many cases, the people who natively speak the Dravidian languages can be fiercely patriotic about them, and will describe themselves as someone who speaks that language.  For instance, many people who speak Kannada will identify themselves as a Kannadiga.

The politics of language in India can get pretty acrimonious.  A parallel in the western world can be drawn in Spain, where people who live in places like Catalonia, Valencia, or Galicia can get a bit pissy about you saying ""Hey, that doesn't sound like Spanish to me!""",64477,"haha, well, there are a lot of dialects in India!",64482,"I always thought that Hindi was the go-to language in India - I think it was referred to as the 'Business Language' so almost a common second tongue.

But, yes, India has quite a lot languages.",64501,"Serious question, is the phrase ""good on you"" or ""good for you?""

I constantly have irrational fears of something happening to my kids. I am always thinking about the butterfly effect, and how if I leave the house 30 seconds later we might get in an accident that we wouldn't have gotten in if we left 30 seconds earlier.

I get anxiety over tiny tiny things that I sometimes muster up enough will power to ignore and other times I can't ignore it. Like I wanted to dim my lights in my dining room the other day before leaving the house but my mind was telling me that dimming the lights could end up causing an electrical fire , and I ended up just shutting them off. Or The light in my kids play room can't be turned off by a switch, it physically has to be unplugged and I unplugged it but felt like the plug fell back onto the outlet in a way that could cause a fire so I had to check it, even though that's literally impossible. 

It's just these little tiny things daily that are completely irrational that if I don't make some small adjustment that I have anxiety and feel like the worst is going to happen, or feel like something just isn't right.

I never felt or thought that these behaviors were acceptable or normal in any way or that the adults in my life, by and large, would see those behaviors as such. It was shocking to me when I first encountered a person who did treat women that way and finding out that there were many such people.

I don't deny that there are people who justify that behavior or act in horrifying ways regarding sexuality; it just was not accepted as the norm the way I was raised and I have never thought/believed that it is/was/should be considered normal.

0,1085,"Ah, from the last bit where you said you miss him when he’s gone and your heart breaks when he hurts himself your whole situation seems much clearer.

I think it’s a fair judgement to say you don’t dislike him or being a mum, but you hate the lifestyle you have unknowingly fallen into as a causality from being a mother.

It’s tricky, but you need to find a way to find a medium between your “old life” and your life as a mother.  Perhaps, if possible, see about doing a few days in the office and the rest at home, getting a professional child carer to look after your child whilst you are there. If that isn’t a feasible idea, perhaps finding some hobbies for you to do with your husband looking after the child, to get some alone time - in the evening and at the weekends.

It will get easier when the child grows older and goes to school, as he will become more independent so constant monitoring won’t be necessary (so you’ll be able to read more books and the likes), and you’ll have the day to yourself whilst he is at school. At that time it may be possible to restart your work at the office.

",1086,"My mother said me being between walking age and school age was a ""run out the clock situation.""

By that, she meant ""I was so depressed but I just grit and bared it until you started head-start (Pre-K). You started that as soon as you could, and not a day sooner.""

School is a parents best reprieve. However schools are getting really shitty now so it makes it hard to bare teenagers, but at least they sit alone during that part of their lives.

I have 2 in daycare and work about 60 hours a week.  I love being a mom. It drives me insane, sometimes I snap at my 3 year old and he cries because I yelled at him, then I cry on my way to work, etc.  but.... when I pick them up it is the best feeling in the world.  Plus, I love my job.  I think you need some adult interaction.  Not just with your husband.  I, too, had 2 very difficult pregnancies and deliveries (2 c-sections, hysterectomy at second due to placenta accreta) I’ve had preeclampsia and post partum preeclampsia.  It’s not fucking easy.  Give yourself the credit for doing what you’ve done.  Also remind yourself that it is IMPOSSIBLE to be on 24/7 and when you’re a SAHM that’s what’s demanded of you.  

I would honestly look into what daycare would be for you... even part-time.  I had to work from home during the end of my last pregnancy due to modified bedrest and I did it about 5 weeks after having my daughter and the hysterectomy because it would be so long before I could go back.  I still sent my son to daycare even though I was home.

Here I am, some random stranger coming into your home to take your loved one to our funeral home.

There I was, wondering what life the deceased had lived, having met their family and in between sobs, hearing an occasional story.

A few days later, the family would come into the funeral home for final arrangements. Unfortunately I had to be the one to tell people, ""Based on your selections, your estimated total is.... "" 

That was always the worst. Hearing a family discuss a viewing, burial, officiant, casket choice, and on more than one occasion,  seeing the look on their faces as they realized they couldn't afford what they wanted to do.

It wasnt being near death, preparing the bodies, performing cremations, helping with the service or the 1am, 2am and 3am calls in one night, it was telling the family what it would cost to cremate or bury their family member.

I'm truly sorry for your loss. As far as I'm concerned there is no right or wrong way to grieve, and I'm a firm believer it's the stories we tell about our loved ones after they've died that keeps them apart of us. Share the joy you and Mark shared, share the heartache you shared together.

Before the ACA, I was able to find exactly one insurance plan that I could afford and it amounted to getting $1000 refunded before I hit my yearly max. Basically, I'd pay for my insulin out of pocket, then send them the receipt for 80% refunded up to a total of $1,000. This was back in 2008 or so, and the price for 3 vials (which is my monthly dosage) was ~ $620. So in 2 months, I would hit my yearly max, then the other $6,200 would be entirely out of pocket. I wound up dipping into college funds my grandparents had set up for me to meet that, but it was not sustainable.

Due to a glitch in the timeclocking software we use, my employer dropped me from insurance for three months back in 2013. Prices had risen to $700 for 3 vials. Under the assumption that it's had a linear increase, that means I'd be looking at $780/mo for insulin alone by next year.

The screeching isn't supportive of women, it's silencing them. We are our own worst enemy sometimes. ",2425,"I agree completely.

Also, in general, when feminists take an interest in understanding the dynamics of consent, abuse, shaming, boundary violations, or anything else relevant to women's welfare, they develop standards in these areas about what is good and bad behavior, and hopefully apply these standards to both men and women's behavior. In other words, someone who has a principled stance against harming women in a certain way will probably know how to apply that stance to men too.

If you automatically assume that women who mistreat men are feminists, you probably don't have a good understanding of most feminists.

I have to look at all the great things he does for us and focus on that, which is an even harder lesson. In the grand scheme, at least for me, having him and being frustrated at stuff like that is better than not having him by... a lot. If you're well past that point and you won't miss him as a person or a deep love, perhaps it's time.

Does he know you feel this strongly about his lack of participation in your relationship?

Anxiety and control issues can be big contributors to a hard homelife, for both spouses. My husband struggles with ADD and I struggle with control and together this can cause serious problems. It's not that he's actively trying to ignore my wishes or piss me off, it's that his brain isn't concentrating on them and my need for control makes the frustration that much more exaggerated. 

Two people are in the relationship, not just him not doing what you want. Seriously look into counseling just for you and if he wants to join you, fantastic. But my best advise is to start with you and the rest will fall into place one way or the other (because we can't change anyone but ourselves).",2756,"I'm far from being bossy.

Just through text, which of course isn't the best way to hear anything, you sound angry. Anger is hurt hidden so if you're hurt because you feel like he's gone back on his word and you can't trust him, that's very much worth exploring.

If you know him enough to know that he's not treating you badly on purpose, like an abuse situation, but is perhaps just clueless then yes - go to therapy with him and be open to it. If you think he's being an obstinate jerk, that's a whole other thing which may be worth exploring if you want to.

I think OP was talking about just minor little problems that can be solved and how people avoid working through it and jump right to divorce instead of trying.  ,3654,"I imagine so. I just tend to see the majority of issues raised here (or maybe it's just that I'm seeing the top ones) as more than minor--like either full-blown crises or serious red flags (controlling behaviors, narcissism, etc.) for future ones.",3655,"That’s true, but everyone has different situations and what happens in the privacy of their own home is frequently not known by outsiders. My parents never knew that my husband was abusing me. My friends didn’t know. I stayed because of THIS kind of mentality. “I have to do whatever it takes to save my marriage”, is what I told myself every day. I was brainwashed to believe that I had to be a good wife and make my marriage work because that’s what society told me to do my whole life. 

Did I marry the wrong guy? Obviously. Did I have any idea he would turn out to be an abusive piece of shit? No. ",3656,"But once again, that’s a major problem that can’t be worked through (IMO) where divorce would 100000% be understandable. I don’t think OP is talking about this kind of thing is all I’m saying because I don’t think anyone would want someone to stay with an abusive asshole. If your friends and family knew what was happening I’m sure they would’ve encouraged leaving. I think you should stay and work on a marriage when it can be saved. That kind of marriage is not salvageable or worth saving. ",3657,"That’s the thing though, when you make a broad statement to young people like, “do what it takes”, they don’t know what justifies leaving a marriage and what doesn’t. Abuse? Cheating? Rape? Sexless marriages? What is okay to leave for and what isn’t? What’s worth forgiving and what isn’t? What is worth working on and what isn’t? 

I just think that this mentality is dangerous. That’s my opinion, of course, and it’s based on my own personal experiences. ",3658,"In my opinion, I will do what it takes to an extent to make my marriage work, as long as it’s healthy. Things like talking it out or counseling etc, but when you get to a point that doesn’t help, your partner won’t work with you and nothing changes, that’s when I’d give up. Things like rape, cheating, abuse, sexless marriage, in my opinion can’t be saved and it definitely very toxic that no one should have to go through in a relationship. I understand some women have that mentality to stay through whatever, and I do not have that mentality. I’ve grown up religious and divorce is frowned upon or whatever, but you have to go when you know it’s time to. Yes marriage is important to me, but I would not sacrifice myself or wellbeing just for the title of wife or sake of staying married. Yes marriage is important to me, but if there ever came a time where I had to choose between losing myself completely, being abused, raped, cheated on, or leaving. I’d leave. Because even though marriage is important to me, my mental health is more important. Divorce is a thing for a reason, but not just any reason. That’s just my opinion. ",3660,"I was forced to marry if I wanted to see my daughter by my ex-wife parents as a highschool kid because my ex-wife was scared of me going away for college, pinched a hole in a condom. I noticed the condom broke and bought day after pills which obviously she didn't take. 

I love my daughter more than anything else but when I was mature enough to realize the bullshit I was into and how unhappy I was, how fucking toxic she was and how much I hated her, I left.

So yeah, divorce was the right choice for me. And for my daughter. Imagine growing up with a miserable father who hates your mother.",3661,"This is exactly why I decided never to marry. You spend a huge portion of your entire life dedicated so someone just to find out later that they were never really dedicated to you. After you find out what are you supposed to do? Just leave? Or be spiritually broken but still married for the rest of your life? I feel like if you chose the option to just leave, depending on how long you're with your spouse itd be alot like when an institutionalized prisoner is released from prison from decades of imprisonment. The world is different and itd be hard to get good footing in the new world. It's a lose lose situation if your trust is misplaced unfortunately ",3662,"I agree that one can continue to be patient with a SO and encourage them to grow or attempt to repair the relationship. My fear is ending up remaining “patient“ for several years when there is no movement on the part of SO. In my case, he’s gone through some health issues and depression but hasn’t modified his lifestyle or re-entered the workforce for 5 years.  Declines to engage in therapy or discuss the state of our relationship in general. There’s also a lack of self-accountability for continuing to operate like this. It’s already an emotional divorce. Next logical step is separation, in my opinion. 

To add another thought, he’s a decent caretaker to our kids, but more so in the way a big brother would be. It does get so much more complicated when kids are involved. "
0,3813,"This is his shame and his guilt and his rot that you are wearing, love. It is not yours. It is not your sister's. You're both going to take it on because you're good, loving people and I can tell that just from this post. You're going to both try to absorb all kinds of hurt and pain and blame from one another and the circumstances around you.

Therapy, therapy, therapy. For you both as individuals and together so you can start to move forward and have support during the fallout of this awful, awful revelation.

And it's OK to still love someone that has done horrible things. It's OK to not understand it and to feel disgusted and wounded and also want to run to that person for comfort, the way you have been doing for years and imagined you would be doing for the rest of your life. It is not all going to heal in an instant, the love and disgust will coexist and smash up against each other. 

It is like floating outside your own body when your trust gets betrayed like that. My situation wasn't the same, but my ex spouse had a life in secret that I never knew about, and he was more dangerous and vile and reckless and frightening than I ever thought possible. I couldn't reconcile it with the man I (thought) I knew. 

At times I'd think *Who will hold me? Who will hold me?* when everything blew up and he was in jail. It felt pathetic to think that way, but I still let myself feel it because it was real. 


It will take time and therapy and more time to snap you back into yourself. It's OK to float in anguish for awhile. That's the only thing for it. 

You will learn to hold yourself. 



The only thing you did was trust the person that you loved- and that isn't a mistake. That's what you're supposed to do. You are a healthy, normal and good person. 

You are showing your sister just how much you love her by charging at this situation with your full force. Even with your broken heart and your confusion and your feelings of unworthiness, you are going to battle for her. That is exactly who she needs you to be.

Edit: Oh my gosh, thank you for the gold! This is unexpected and really validating. Cool. What a bunch of great people hanging around in this sub. Goodness. ",3815,"I was in a pretty rough head space right before I read your story (my post history will confirm this) and hearing your voice snapped me right out of my funk. 

Lady I have felt that terror and isolation down in my marrow. I have looked at my babies and not been able to explain any of it to them, I have had to live my trauma right the fuck in front of everyone...all of them just WATCHING the worst tragedy of my life.

It is a nightmare. This really IS that bad. You are in crisis, falling apart is pretty much neccessary. 

I'm here to let you know that you are not alone and you're going to get through it, even though it seems like the worst shit just will not stop. I remember ranting, kind of maniacally, on more than one occasion to anyone who would listen, ""There are trap doors! I keep thinking it is rock bottom and holy shit another trap door! It will not end! What the fuck?!""

That's going to happen, too.

You're going to get through it.

I suggest journaling. All the honest, embarrassing, pathetic, angry stuff that you can't say to other people and barely want to admit to yourself. 

You're also going to need a family therapist sooner rather than later. I waited too long to find help for my kids during the crisis we were having and I was so overwhelmed trying to care for them and care for myself. All the advice out there is about how to co-parent respectfully or how to sit down with your kids and your spouse and explain that mommy and daddy love them very much but aren't going to be together anymore...but?? 

How in the fuck do you explain to a child that their dad, their hero, their DAD, is a bad guy and is going to jail?

How do you say that to your kids and hold them while they process it in their tiny little hearts?

I sure as hell didn't know, and I dropped the ball on that. I found a social worker through their pediatrician as soon as I could but god, I have so many regrets with how I handled that.


OK too much logistics talk. You can PM me anytime you want to talk or just wail or mash your keyboard with your fists. Please, please do. 

And for your heart:  try your very best to not let this experience rob you of your goodness and your big heart. Don't lose faith in people. Work hard on learning how to trust yourself and your choices and know that you are worthy of a good life filled with good, kind people. 

They are everywhere. This bad apple is not representative of humanity. You might feel small and afraid to let someone see you, or know you, or hold you.  But oh my god be vulnerable. Crack wide open, you and your baby sister. You will be so amazed at the love that can pour in. And you will be so amazed at your own strength in recognizing the people who share your same heart, and dismissing the people who no longer serve you. 

This is one of the moments in your life which will show you who you truly are. 

You're going to be OK. 

I don't know you, but I love you. Sending big glowy care-bear style hearts right to you from my perch here sitting on top of my kids' mountain of laundry that I haven't folded. A year ago I was in shambles. Today I just have a list of chores to do. It's all going to be OK (then horrible, then OK, then horrible, then OK and eventually you'll be a pro).

I would be afraid you would lose custody if you dont. 

People make all kinds of wild accusations during a divorce as a tactic. Divorce courts rarely even issue restraining orders because they are used as a tool.

Sounds like you have been taking all the right steps though; I hope it goes well for you.",4073,"I can empathize a lot with the emotions you are going through.

Though my experience is not the same, the emotions you describe are very similar.

My sister recently plead guilty to attempted murder and willful cruelty to a child with great bodily injury.  She was originally charged with 4 counts of willful cruelty to a child causing great bodily injury and 2 counts of Torture (this carries a mandatory life sentence).  My niece was 4 years old when she was arrested.

I was so, so angry.  At her, at my family for perpetuating the abuse, at anyone who regularly interacted with her or my nieces (I didn't) and especially my mother who was with my sister a month before her arrest. I felt so much guilt.  I should have known.  What if I could have saved her from this.  I had some suspicions of neglect but no evidence, hell I didn't know where my sister lived. I felt I should have called anyway.  So, so much guilt.  These are emotions that are expected and are regarded as normal.

What isn't expected is the sense of loss.  I lost my sister.  Even though we had a strained relationship as adults, she was my baby sister. That is gone and I grieve for the sister I had and loss of the potential sister I may have had in the future. The baby sister I had, the one I grew up with, the one I tried to keep safe is dead; replaced by a stranger who looks and talks the same but is someone else. I still grieve for her. I felt betrayed by her.  How could she do something so monstrous? Especially after the abuse we endured. We promised each other not to repeat the pattern.  She broke our most sacred promise.  I still have a hard time dealing with these particular emotions but it is getting better. 

I just wanted you to know that you aren't alone in experiencing these emotions, though the circumstances are different. I want you to know your feelings are valid.  I will not tell you it will be ok but I will tell that what you are feeling is ok.  You are allowed to feel this way.

You are incredibly brave.  What you did is a heroic and very selfless act.  You stood up for a child who needed it and may not have been able to standup for themselves.  Hopefully, you have helped stop a cycle of abuse for at least one child.  Thank you for that.

I dont even know how to explain that feeling.  I can try to explain the *reason* I feel that way.

My sister and I are only about 17 months apart.  We were very, very close growing up.  We endured some very traumatic experiences together.  I thought I knew her.  I know she made some bad decisions and was living a life that I felt was unhealthy but it wasn't much different than some of the things I had done when I was younger. I just got my shit together when I was still young. I thought I knew what her core value system was. I thought one of those core values was to not hurt a child, much less your own.

What my sister did to her own child was so abhorrent that, in my mind, it was not possible that someone with that value system, that sense of ""right and wrong,"" could have done those things. I can not reconcile the person my sister is today with the person she was.  It's incomprehensible to me for a person to change that drastically in such a short time. I grieve for the sister I knew. The person she is today, the person she changed into, is a complete stranger to me.

I have recovered in the sense that I have learned to live with it.  You never really get over something so devastating emotionally. I have chosen to learn from it and it has made me an advocate for children who are abused, as well as social workers.

Actually allowing OP their very complicated feelings - all of them - without judgment - is what is needed here. Being allowed to fully explore those feelings will show how the situation is not black and white and she has done what she can. But you don't get there by denying those feelings.

What you may not understand is when you dismiss those complicated feelings is exactly the source of the problem that allows sexual abuse in families to continue as cycles. 

When someone you love and who provides for you and protects you (and then add all of the expectations about family from society as well) - when they violate that trust at a young age, it's such a large conflict of feelings that it's much easier to dismiss the problematic ones (my loved one is hurting me) and to accept the abuse and to file it away, to disassociate. I love my parent/grandparent/sister, why are they hurting me? Or - I'm told I'm supposed to love my parent, so I must, but they hurt me. None of this seems right so the problem must be me.

Feeling guilty is a natural part of grieving. Denial of that can cause many problems.

OP, feel your feelings. It's a going to be a big mess of complications - loving your husband but being very angry at him. Seeing them (MIL, SIL and husband) both as victims and perpetrators. They can be both. 

I want to say I probably sound like I'm jumping down your throat. I understand why you don't want OP to feel guilty because she's done everything she reasonably can. But that's something she must work through actively, not dismiss as an unallowed emotion. You are saying this from a place of support and support is very important.

0,4720,"My ex was neither gay nor cheating nor asexual, but had serious intimacy issues. He found me attractive but didn't want a physical relationship after the first few months, and couldn't explain why. I suspect it was from childhood trauma/sexual abuse that he wasn't acknowledging, even to himself (doctors even found signs, and he still wouldn't face it). Maybe it's something like that for your husband. (In which case not even wanting to go to the movies would just be part of keeping you at a safe distance.)

Instead of telling him what you want (again), consider asking him what he wants out of the relationship. If his answer doesn't include becoming a full-fledged couple, and he isn't willing to start taking concrete steps toward that immediately, you'll be doing everyone a favor if you seek an annulment ASAP.

Although many people in arranged marriages do fall in love and end up happy.",4724,Maybe he’s gay?,4726,Could he be upset about an arranged marriage and is seeing a person of his own choosing on the side?,4728,"I don't mean to be disrespectful of anyone's cultural traditions, so I hope my genuine curiosity isn't taken as such.

Arranged marriages are so foreign to me that I don't understand how one could be arranged and not pressured. Isn't the inherent nature of them that at least one party is pressured to some extent? ",4730,"Oh okay. That certainly sounds more forgiving than the traditional way!

Thank you for the explanation. I do hope that you can find a way to work on it amicably together. You can't do it alone. ",4731,"Are you sure this was the case for him? I don’t know much about arranged marriages culture but had my fair read of different of those situations in here. Do you think if he was gay or in love with someone who is not perceived as good (divorced, already pregnant, other race, other religion) his family would put him into a setting where he would fear for his life? My best advice is to talk to him and assure him confidentiality as you don’t certainly know what got him to accept his marriage with you but certainly is not going in a great direction. ",4732,"So, if both of you had a choice, what made you agree to marry him, if he has not been intimate at all with you?",4733,"Arranged marriages are different from forced marriages. I’ll try to explain arrangements, because it has been explained to me. This may be specific to his country/culture, I’ve not had the opportunity to discuss the topic with people who come from different countries where it is common.

My SO comes from a country where arranged marriages are very common. Some of his siblings even had arranged marriages, and his parents. The way it tends to work is that a family member would chose someone because they know that individual’s family and know them to be good, upstanding people, or perhaps friends of the potential groom/bride’s siblings. The chosen person to be the spouse is introduced to who the family are trying to hook them up with, they meet a few times and based on how they get along, both parties can choose to either get engaged or pass. When they become engaged, they don’t plan a wedding immediately. Instead, they are engaged for a while and during this time they spend time together, and it becomes like a relationship you’d be more familiar with, where they get to know each other better and see if they are truly compatible. Once both potential spouses decide on compatibility, they can either choose to break off the engagement or start to plan for a wedding. It can get complicated because families of the potential spouses have to have a good relationship too, and sometimes two people could be perfect for each other but if the families don’t like each other, it could be called off based on that. It’s definitely something that can become very frustrating, but my SO’s culture revolves heavily around family, they spend a lot of time together, and ensuring a potential spouse comes from a nice family would mean they could be held accountable if things go wrong. 
My SO’s sister has hooked up their brother with one of her friends, I don’t recall how his other siblings ended up meeting their spouses, but I know some of them have found their own spouses and this wasn’t a problem in the family, and they are all very happy. As are his parents. He is a less traditional person who would prefer to date and that’s okay.

Where my SO is from, a lot of people would prefer to have an arrangement rather than find their own potential spouse because dating can be a lot of trial an error when you meet a complete stranger and families would tend to make sure they find someone suitable to their nature and their needs, someone who is known and trusted and basically wouldn’t treat them like shit. So when it is done properly, I can definitely see how this can work out well. Also, divorce isn’t frowned upon and it does happen, rightly so. 

On the other hand, of course people can be pressured to accept and stay with their spouse and that’s when it becomes a forced marriage. Also, an arranged marriage, even when done properly, can still end up going badly(people change over time, lack of intimacy, falling out of love, arguing, abuse etc) and can end in divorce. But then let’s go back to relationships based on dating, people who are just dating and getting married can also end up in the same kind of situation. We are all human beings at the end of the day, and even if we think everything has been done properly, even if we think we have met the perfect person, bad people always find a way to slip through the cracks. 

I had kind of the same view as yourself when it came to this topic, but after my SO explained it to me, I understood the pros and cons a lot better(because in countries where arranged marriages aren’t common, they are painted as evil, terrible and not differentiated from forced marriages). 
The bottom line is that they are just different approaches to relationships, sometimes they have a happy ending, sometimes they do not, but it shouldn’t be assumed that if someone has an arranged marriage that they are in a forced situation. ",4734,"Yes, I can understand how having family influence in that manner could be an asset. If the families have their business straight and their ducks in a row, it makes sense. Really no difference from what still is culturally common in the US south - where I grew up and still live - of families wanting their young women dating someone from a family with a well-established business, professional career, or the like.

Many years ago, my mom somehow found a young man of someone she knew whose father owned a franchise store of a lucrative motor parts company. She schemed around until he showed up to take me to dinner and a movie one night. Obviously I couldn't refuse to go because southern women aren't rude, and mom would've been embarrassed. It was a disaster because we couldn't have possibly been more different. There wasn't a second date haha!

Looking at relationships here, though, my first thought is, ""You don't even have your own life together. What makes you think you know what I need in mine?""

That's a lack of experiences in my own life of not having healthy, big, fun, caring families as good examples on a personal level, and not living in another country where that is the norm. So thinking that it works out well anywhere is hard to wrap my head around based on what I know of the concept.

I actually wouldn't mind immersing in a society with traditions such as what you described. Do you mind sharing where your SO is from?

Thank you for the effort you put into explaining it!"

I am going to assume that yall have already had that talk (probably multiple times) and have not been able to come to a compatible arrangement.

There is nothing wrong with leaving someone because you are not compatible, and nothing wrong with taking 20 years for an incompatibility to become too much to be worth it.

My family is trying really hard to ask him how he's feeling so he'll keep telling us his feelings and reminding him that it doesn't mean he's too weak to keep us from worrying. It means he's strong enough to trust us with something so valuable and private to him. 

You honestly don't seem to need much more advice because you're right where my family was after the incident.

I also think you should skip thanksgiving and stuff you know they will attend for a while since it'll be hard to watch and not good for you at all. Just spend it with a friend or don't do anything at all, who cares about holidays anyways? 
Feel free to pm me if you need to vent. Stay strong, you are better on your own!",5605,"Too right. Fuck forcing yourself to endure thanksgiving and christmas with low life pieces of shit like that.

Never see either of them again
0,5709,"For what it’s worth: it’s good that you are seeing the error of your ways and are taking the initiative to improve yourself. That is the only thing that can be expected of you at this point so try not to beat yourself up over this any longer. 

I can totally feel how difficult this must be, having experienced break-ups myself (one after 13 years and currently in one). Realistically, there is a  chance that you and your wife will not be able to make amends and reunite. This is very hard to accept, so you will need time and go through a lot of pain for that to sink in. It sucks enormously, but don’t resist the pain. Take your moments to let it wash over you. The fact that you seem to be able to do this means that you can overcome your emotional insensitivity. 

However, you will also need time to become a new version of you, a better version. If your wife still has feelings left for you she may see the effort you have put into becoming this better version and over time and more importantly, the results. 

Wishing you all the strength possible to deal with this loss, and also to work on yourself. I hope things between you and your wife will turn out for the better eventually.

He was controlling, he was overbearing, and he was overprotective. His problem was that he wouldn't admit fault no matter what.

The counseling will help, your personal counseling will help, if you truely wish to change for the better and yourself.

Perhaps, as things hopefully improve, there can be a code word she can use to help you and her recognize when it's happening.

Stay strong, have an open mind, and listen to her/your counselor very carefully. ",5712,"My ex of 20 years was like you. Unlike you, he wanted to control me in every way he could. He needed to know my every move, wanted to know where I spent my money, whom I was with, where I was... His jealousy was atrophying our relationship.

Unlike you, he never saw the error of his ways, and we have been separated for 2.5 years. I commend you for recognizing the problem and working towards it. It's not easy to see one's own faults. 

Best of luck to you.",5713,I really hope you both make it - sometimes you don’t realise your errors until you reflect on them - but the fact she’s willing to go to therapy and you’re seeking to change show great signs of willing to better yourself for your marriage ,5714,"Just read this on an advice thread that Dad’s give to their sons. “You fucked up, but you’re not fucked up. Time to move past it and forgive yourself” don’t be too hard on yourself my man. ",5715,"Hey man, you're acknowledging your fault and actively trying to improve yourself. Congrats, you're doing better than most of humanity. 

But for real, seeing faults in ones own personality is fucking hard. I'm not saying these problems are on your wife's shoulders, but if she was struggling for so long she should have communicated it a lot sooner. You can't fix a problem you aren't aware of, and now that you see it you are doing something about it. I really hope your wife recognizes that and works through these issues with you. You guys are in a partnership, for better or worse, so this issue is for both of you to solve. Keep improving yourself, loving your wife, and I really hope things work out for the best, pal. ",5716,"It’s amazing that you’re accepting your responsibility for the breakdown of your marriage. 

Going to therapy and bettering yourself will set you up for success. I would say though that you can talk to your wife and ask if she is willing to give it another shot, but she has every right to say no. 

My ex went absolutely batshit when he promised to go to therapy and “make big changes” and I was past the point of wanted to work it out. Honestly, I wasn’t trying to be cruel but five+ years of pain killed any love I might have had. (Spoiler alert: two years on, he has not made positive changes, he just wanted me to keep putting up with his garbage.)

We needed that time apart to focus on our own things and we both knew we loved each other and wanted to work on it.

The writer covers the story of Maryann Gray, who hit a young boy who ran out in front of her car when she was 22 and would be pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital, how it affected her life, and more broadly, what people like Gray and you deal with.

Hopefully this article, and the organization the article mentions - [Accidental Impacts](http://accidentalimpacts.org/) - can provide you with some psychological comfort. From their homepage:

> We are good people who have unintentionally harmed others, in accidents occurring on the roads, at work, at play, or around the home. I call us CADI’s (Causing Accidental Death or Injury). Most of us feel grief, guilt, and distress about our accidents. Over time, we learn that our mistake does not have to define us.

The bus stop was proved to block line of vision for up to 6 seconds and has caused several accidents. It wasn't her fault. He didn't have his lights on either. He was a good kid with a promising future. She held him. She comforted him. She is a surgical nurse and did what she could.  It happened on the street she lives on and she drives over the spot of impact on a daily basis. At first I thought she was going to sell the house and move far away. Litigation made that impossible. I asked her recently how she handles it. She says she thinks of him all the time, what he'd be learning in school, how many lives he could have gone on to save. Then she remembers that she saves lives too. And now she does it for him. She donates to scholarship funds in his name. She mentors. Maybe volunteer with at risk and homeless people?

Met a guy who gave me a fake age and name, really started to fall for him, felt I was special because of the ""thoughtful"" gifts he would bring me, lost my virginity to him after he didn't respect my clear desire to not have sex, and then had him end things with me by saying I was immature (I was 18 and going into my senior year in high school, what did he think?) and basically called me a liar when I tried to explain that I wasn't able to contact him for a week because of being abruptly hospitalized and without my phone. It was heartbreaking at the time and I had felt like I had lost someone I really felt connected to; I just felt so very foolish. What was worst was realizing I couldn't find him online at all with the name and information he had given me. It wasn't until almost two years after everything that I finally found out who he was by finally finding his real name attached to the number he had used to call me. He was not four years older than me (an age difference I established as my age limit for dating before meeting him), he was 10 years older. He wasn't single, he was in a serious and committed relationship with a wonderful woman who he married and had a child with not within a year after ending things with me. I also read and learned all I could about the woman he betrayed and found she was a very intelligent and beautiful person, inside and out. Finding all this out opened the wound I had and all I could feel was pain from the memory of it all, guilt for being so foolish at the time, and anger towards him after now knowing he truly had deceived me. I wasn't strong enough to contact his wife, I was and am scared of being blamed or not believed, or creating a situation that causes more harm than good. It might not be right, but I don't know that I would ever tell her what he did. I'm healing still, I'm lucky enough to have found an amazing husband who loves me and has always supported me and understood why this is something I am still healing from to this day.

You're just torturing yourself, slowing down the process of healing, and keeping ties with the guy (even though your intention might be to show that you have no ties with him). It doesn't matter what he thinks about you. What matters is how you feel when you walk in there. You have the right to walk into your gym and be comfortable and inspired rather than feeling awkward and tense.",5855,"But it's my gym. My place. My friends work there, I know everyone. It's my happy place. If I leave, I'm bowing down to him.",5856,"What you've said is kind of my point - and it's something we all do. When you say that your leaving would be bowing down to the guy, what you're saying is that you're still in this fight. You're still giving energy to the idea of a power dynamic between the two of you. It's a stance of trying to prove something to him or yourself, and that requires thinking about him one way or another. The point though, is you can *truly* let go of your relationship to him and focus on respecting your own feelings.

Of course, do as you see fit, but if going to that gym makes you angry, hurt, self-conscious, awkward, anxious, hopeful, nostalgic, etc., then it seems more destructive to you than helpful. I'm not saying it has to be forever, but your friends can meet you somewhere else in the meantime.

I hope you get closure on this sooner rather than later, regardless of what you do about the gym.",5858,"I get what you're saying, and I agree. However, in this case, it seems like OP is avoiding her feelings by continuing to go to the gym​. Of course, I don't know what's going on in her head or heart, but from what she says, it sounds like the classic ""pretend I'm fine so the other person either doesn't win or doesn't see how hurt I am"" that so many people fall into after a breakup. That approach is totally normal, but avoids real feelings and is counter to what you're talking about, imo. It means the focus is still on the other person instead of on respecting her own feelings.

I'm not saying never go back there. I'm just saying respect your feelings and give yourself some time to heal a little and gain some perspective so that when you do go back, the idea of bowing down to this guy (or even if he thinks that's what's happening) isn't part of the things you care about anymore.

Disclaimer: I'm saying this from my own experience as well, and I don't fully know the way OP's healing will go. All I know is that, for me, a situation like this usually meant I was avoiding how bad I felt. Once I respected my feelings enough to stop forcing myself into painful situations, I actually gained more confidence and those situations became less painful on their own.",5859,"You're making it out to be something it isn't, a symbol.

What you're going through sounds like a very normal response to trauma and you have every right to ""freak out"" when you hear an alarm or any similar sound. You are probably already aware of this, but there's little that can be done for that except time and awareness of these triggers going forward. 

I'm sorry that you did not get any comfort from people walking past. The human brain responds to the pain of others in a very peculiar way, and it's very likely those people simply did not feel equipped to help you properly and figured giving you space was the best thing to do. It sounds like the facility is taking steps to make sure this doesn't happen again, and I'm sure you can ask them what else can be done here.

I gave her a huge shake, and she started again, and eventually we got her to the hospital and she was all right.

From the way you describe him, it doesn't necessarily seem like a lost cause. He just needs to learn how to manage expectations and communicate better than pouting. To be honest, the clinginess is only half the problem--it's the fact that he's so emotionally childlike that you have to literally cannot relax around him for fear of upsetting him in some way.

They have interests apart from each other.  They have a beer or two on the porch around 5, have dinner and watch a little tv, then break off to an office or bedroom and then go to bed later.

If OP feels like she has to watch her words and actions and thoughts around him, that sounds like a symptom of an even deeper problem. ",5976," Eh, I get what she means though.  It's not like she's worried about looking pretty or sounding smart... she just wants to be able to watch a tv show without feeling obligated to make conversation and be ""on"".  I don't care how comfortable I am with someone, I'm not going to give them the silent treatment until they leave me alone, I'm going to acknowledge their existence and engage.  Sometimes you just want to be so alone that there isn't even a possibility that you are going to have to engage with other people. 
",5977,When you live with someone though that has to happen. Its fine for you to be just watching tv while the other person does something else. You cant be on all the time.,5978,"Idk, I feel the same way in social situations. I actually relate a lot to this post. I'm a quiet reserved person that overthinks/overanalizes social situations so it's super draining and I just need my space. My SO also is a little too clingy as I see him pretty much every day until I have some meltdown of feeling smothered and end up pushing him away. I got issues maybe haha. But I literally do watch what I say/do around people. I thought it was more because I'm a sappy people pleaser that doesn't want to bother anyone haha. But ya I don't know. My SO is certainly not abusive, and I feel bad I feel that way. But that's nothing we can't talk about and work through. Some people just need space. "

Also fuck that coworker. Just as in the wrong, if you don't like what I say tell me! If I am an asshole and ignore your request then go ahead and complain.
  
I had a similar experience with a coworker going to my boss in my last job. Her and I got talking about mental health and stuff and I mentioned that I am seeing a psychologist for Borderline Personality Disorder, she asked me a few follow up questions, next thing I knew my boss was telling me that he had gotten a complaint because I made a coworker uncomfortable by talking about my BPD. It left me feeling so betrayed. ",6205,"Omfg, it's like people think they can complain because THEY don't like the information that THEY ASKED FOR. Then ffs, don't ask for the information in the first place!! I'm sorry, fuck her.",6206,Right?!? It's soo stupid! I don't understand people like that. I also really don't understand why they feel the need to pretend to show interest in something that is making them feel uncomfortable enough to complain about it officially.

You will have some panic attacks. That's okay. After doing that, reward yourself. Seriously, just go out and walk and listen to your favorite band from high school. Watch porn (serious, if it helps to reward yourself).

Life really dealt you a fucked hand at the card game of life. 

I have never experienced anything on that level but have been without a job and living off the government and worked really shitty jobs and stayed in crap living arrangements just to get by so can relate to your struggles to a degree  so i really feel for you.

From what I read, you have a very good head on your shoulders and seem resourceful. Use it. Suck it up being a slave just a little longer. Its a roof over your head for now but PLAN to get out. Use them as a resource to springboard you into a direction you want to see yourself moving towards. I know its a shit situation being your sister and brother in-laws lil house slave but its security where you can rest your head and plan bigger steps. In the past you managed to continuously pick yourself up and even those around you. Do it again. I know its not fare and I know its not easy but all you have is yourself and you better focus on yourself now. Screw everyone else from this point on. Try as much as you can to put little bit of cash aside and not for a car, that’s unnecessary expenses (gas, services, insurance ect ect.) the whole world of people use busses and trains.  Focus on getting you in a secure (even if its crap for now) space of your own, where you can work and focus on your future. 

You are 21, you have so much time ahead of you. I know its way to much responsibility to have for a 21 year old but you better make lemonade with those lemons, baby. 

Im turning 29 and Im only now getting to a space where I feel “secure”. I have a good paying job, just bought my first car after using public transport since I was 18 and finally I stay alone in a small bachelors pad with my cat (before this I use to stay in a house share with 4 other guys and a crazy land lord who use to lock me out the house, go through my shit and stole from me and before that I shared a room with a crack addict... fun times). I once even had sex for cash so that I can buy dinner... I have so much respect for sex workers now. I can finally focus on saving money for my old age and every day I fear that Its to late but, I remind myself of my goals and put money aside as much as I can every month a little more when possible. 

Have you thought of a Go Fund me page or some sort of crowed funding? Where if people want to help you, if they can or want to? 

Edit: 
I read your page a little and noticed you have traveled to Japan and Thailand? Don’t seem like you having it to hard if at the age of 20 or so you have traveled twice internationally... ",6289,I think Thailand is cheaper than most places from what I heard. 
0,6382,"I am not far from your town and I know quite a few people out and around the area who can offer any help if you need it, myself included. 

Please, don't do anything to yourself. I had a strange similar situation and please believe that you will get past this",6383,"This. So sorry this happened to you OP. I've heard some bad things from friends about the Erie/western PA area in regards to bigots/etc. but I'm mortified to hear that this happened to you. I'm probably a bit further from you (about 3 hours east), but if there's anything I can do to help/if you just need someone to talk to, I'd be more than willing.

Best wishes!",6384,"I'm from that area originally and it is a shithole of bigotry and generally not so great people. Some good ones, of course, but mostly not in my experience.

I'll be in the area this weekend if you need to get out or need someone to talk to just to get the weight off your chest.",6385,"I am so angry hearing about this, that a town can turn against a person so completely. And what if she had chosen to have the baby? Would they have given all the necessary support? I believe not. 

I have a lot of relatives in rural PA, and seen first hand the judgey conservative small-mindedness that runs rampant in places like that. I am filled with anxiety every time I visit that place. 

Fuck PA in general, and religious small town conservative politics in particular. The only good solution may be to move away and let these people pat each other on the back and nod in agreement until they die. ",6386,"Firstly, please don't do anything to harm yourself. This is absolutely something that will get better with time. 

I don't usually think of leaving the state as a viable option to escape one's turmoil but I think that's a very good idea here. Do you have the means? You said you took money to get a house... did you buy it? Can you get out? As you said, there's nothing for you there anymore. Even though this may blow over eventually, the damage it could do in the mean time could push you over the edge. Get out of that town, better yet the state, and don't tell them where you're going. None of them. Perhaps in the future you can have a relationship with your parents again but only if you want to.",6387,My advice also. Get the fuck outta there! ,6389,Same. /u/Ceno-bitten said it best: there's nothing there holding you back anymore. That town has *nothing* to offer you. I wouldn't hold my breath for forgiveness; just be rid of them.,6390,"Yeah seriously /u/tossoutaccoutn233, that's my recommendation too. Also for the time being delete all of your social media. It might not completely stop your ex from tracking you but hopefully no one else will be able to. Change all your passwords if he has any of them.

Move as far away as you can. There has to be somewhere for you to go, but there's nothing for you in Erie anymore.

I'm so sorry about your dog, and please don't harm yourself. You did what you thought was right. Raising a child with Down's is a gargantuan task and it's not for everybody.",6391,"Backing this one up. Choose your state well and start anew. I understand that starting over won't be easy but it's doable and you will get to choose who is in your life. Because we usually don't choose that much, family is imposed and friends we make at work or at school and if the environment does not propose the same values that you have, you end up with a bunch of assholes. Do not hurt yourself, you seem like a strong lady and we need strong lady. I would've done the same. PM me if you need support or just to chat, I'm sure others have offered, please do it, don't stay alone in this.",6392,"Yeah I agree with everybody else. Delete all social media, look into moving to a new state, to an area far more relaxed about abortion (you could move to another staunchly Christian area but if the abortion came out you may have to do this all over again), rescue an unloved pooch from the pound, get some therapy. Of all those, I think therapy is the more immediate thing you can do, and if you have any people in your life who aren't against you right now, consider leaning on them a little more for emotional support.

Edit - and to add to that, change your phone number(s) and email addresses. And this might sound harsh but given that your family, including your mother, is against you right now I wouldn't trust them with any of your new personal information, only give that to people you know wouldn't give it out.",6393,"Holy shit. I'm so sorry you're going through this. This is way above our paygrade, you need to call the police or a lawyer to get actual protection from your ex. No clue how it works where you are, but I think you can get a restraining order. 

Also, it seems more realistic that your ex killed your dog than ""some anti-abortion person found out and was so disgusted that they came to my house to kill my dog"". I'm sorry. 

I don't know what else to say. It breaks my heart to read your story. Only you can decide whether you want to carry a child; you did not want to, and you made the right choice, despite having to face all these shitty people. I had no idea that so many people could react this way to some person getting an abortion. Feel free to follow up if you want to talk",6394,This. I hope that piece of shit sees justice for killing that dog. The story makes it sound like it was almost definitely him.  He had a motive. He indicated it was a revenge killing because of the abortion. Please press charges. And get a restraining order. He needs to fucking pay. 
0,6552,"He doesn't have to die for you to be happy. Separate. Divorce. Bring in a caregiver a few times a week so that you can get the break you need. It seems as if you feel that you owe him in some way. You also owe it to yourself to be happy and take care of your own health. 

",6553,"You're right. He doesn't. If you notice my last paragraph above, I didn't only say that I wished he would die--I also said ""*Or that I would die.*""

Believe me, the chances are that I'll die first. He has received the best medical care available--I saw to that and I've continued to see to it. Despite his viciousness toward me, I have continued to care for him in the exact same way I cared for him before his personality changed. He would have died a dozen times over if it hadn't been for the care I provide for him--making doctor appointments, scheduling rides, ensuring that his every need is addressed.

The only person in real danger physical danger here is me. Shortly after he began demonstrating hostility toward me, I developed dangerously high blood pressure. Last June I had the first of a series of mini-strokes. According to what he said afterward, I was unconscious for at least 20 minutes--but when I came to with dizziness, weakness, and a blinding headache, he told me not to call 911 because ""You'll be fine.""

On Friday I tore a ligament in my shoulder while shoveling snow. I went grocery shopping anyway. I prepared dinner anyway. And I have continued to do housework and care for him despite having an injured shoulder (and a previous knee injury that has me wearing a brace). The outburst that lead to the OP occurred because I asked him to help me out by making some phone calls to see if anyone could bring us bottled water. (The pipes were frozen and with a blizzard coming in, I won't be able to carry water bottles to a neighbor's to be filled.) He went ballistic. Because I asked him to help me by making a couple of phone calls.

My point here is that he is in no danger at all. I continue to treat him like royalty--not because I believe I owe him, but because I'm a compassionate human being. Again, I'm the only one in danger here. I'm being abused. I'm very sick and not only does he expect to receive the same level of care regardless of my health, he makes things worse by abusing me.",6554,"IMO, rescuing him at this point is more moot than it is compassionate. It sounds like the strokes already took the man you loved.

If that man saw the person inhabiting his body now, what would he think?",6555,"You also say ""anything to be free from this monster"". I was just pointing out measures that are less drastic than death. 

You a compassionate wife and person. Not many would continue to go the distance as you have. I commend you for that. But, on the other hand you can't do all these things knowingly putting yourself in harm's way-physically & emotionally and then complain. There are things you can actively do to make this situation somewhat better. It is up to you to take charge or continue to have a pity party. 

Your choice, OP. ",6556,"You've made a lot of assumptions based on a small amount of information. I haven't listed all the things I've done.

Also, the fact that you use the phrase ""pity party"" shows that you're basically no better than my husband. Does it make you feel powerful to kick people when they're down?",6558,Isn't off my chest supposed to be kind and supporting?,6559,It started off that way but she became the aggressor when she started with her assumptions and defensive attitude. ,6560,Well the use of pity party when someone is seeking counsel is pretty demeaning.

When you do something for someone (husband or anyone else) you don't do it to rattle it off to say ""look what I've done"". You do it because you care. 

And you're making assumptions well. Do not compare me to your husband when I was simply providing helpful suggestions into first and second post. If you're really tired of the situation, then you will  do something other than complain. You have options.

Good day. ",6562,"Could you sum up the (presumably incorrect) assumptions /u/swagoo_88 has made please? Tbh, to me their comment wasn't particularly presumptuous...",6563,"I think you're doing great!

It's also important to talk to his doctor about these symptoms and behavioural changes, so the doctor can determine what is happening and if he should prescribe meds for him.

I hope you get more and more empowered and feel like the strong woman you are every day. Much love to you!"
0,6867,At least he was honest before you got married and it could have been so much more difficult. Yes it was a shitty situation but find some comfort that it wasn't on the wedding day or after you swore in front of all your loved one that you would be together forever. ,6868,"I agree that now is better than later, but OP also please remember that you've experienced a loss that you are allowed to mourn that loss in whatever shape that takes. Just because it could be worse, doesn't mean it's not absolute shit. ",6869,I agree but I was trying to try and shine a little light on a shitty situation ,6870,"Yes, this. I had the same experience as OP. Only mine happened after 10 years of marriage and 2 kids. He left me 3 days after Christmas. It's a terrible situation, but you are awesome and you will have a fantastic life. ",6871,"Not sure why people in this sub always downplay serious issues. There aren't many redeeming qualities about this situation, acknowledge that and show solidarity. Don't justify what happened. Literally every comment on this thread attempts to justify the situation. 

The lack of empathy is astounding. OP was venting, she still clearly loves him yet people are insinuating that she dodged a bullet and she'll find someone better. That's not what anyone wants to hear after a breakup, that it was all for the best. You're all contradicting and therefore trivializing OPs feelings. She wouldn't want to hear about how this a good thing or not as bad as it could be, that's not going to change anything.

The ideal response would be something like ""that really sucks, I can't imagine what it must be like for you right now (or share if you've been somewhere similar), I hope you're able to move on.

Yes! Exactly. Well said. ",6878,Because she is a human being who sounds like a person trying to get through one of the hardest things there can ever be to get through. Everyone deserves better than that. Well.. almost everyone. Everyone but you.,6879,^^ what this person said
0,6934,"I ride as well and can't even imagine the pain you're feeling. Sorry that happened, I'm wishing for the best outcome possible for you and your steed. ",6935,Thanks for your kind words. Looks like everything will be okay. Insurance adjuster will come by early next week to assess the damage and ship it to my dealer!,6937,"Depends on the force. This sounds like a knock and kept backing over, pushing it across the pavement, nit just a tap to throw it off balance.",6938,"Well I guess it depends on the bike. The mechanic at the Yamaha dealer said that all plastics that were scratched will get replaced. It is cheaper to replace a plastic fairing that costs $150, than spend a few hours of shop labour and skill to touch up a piece of bodywork.

I mean, my Yamaha is almost ten years old. Something like a new Ducati or BMW would cost an absolute fortune to repair. 

I guess part of the appeal of dirt bikes is the grittiness and dirt trail riding. It's okay if they get scratched or knocked around a bit, but a street bike belongs rubber side down.",6939,"Glad to hear that. So frustrating how they responded to how you decided to reasonably handle the situation. But good thing it's working out! I can barely go days without riding when my baby's in perfect running order, I can't imagine having my bike out of commission due to a couple knob heads haha. ",6940,I work in the claims department for an insurance company. You did the right thing. There was no guarantee that they were going to repair your vehicle let alone repair it well!! ,6941,"Same here- and yeah, OP, you chose the right path. I get *so many* calls of 'we would have come to you sooner, but the other person said they'd pay for it then got cold feet when we gave them a quote'.",6942,"Absolutely. This is great to hear. Yeah so once the bike is towed to the dealer, what's stopping them from walking away? I actually spoke with a mechanic there yesterday and it looks like with parts, labour, inspection, and towing, the bill would be over $3500. ",6943,"Yeah I completely agree I feel for accidents happening, shit happens,but they were the cause and you shouldn't have to worry about their possibly shoddy parts and repair schedule I would have done the same.

It's not trying to be a jerk, it's getting your stuff back to where it should be because they fucked up. I get them wanting to save money but it's simply not your fault and you shouldn't be further put out because they fucked up. Besides if they're trying to save money being biased towards themselves the work and parts will likely be inferior ",6944,My dad always told me that a person's willingness to pay for repairs is directly proportional to their driving skills.,6945,"Lol, I hope you don't feel bad about any of this because they're harassing you.

They're just too damn lazy to clean a goddamn mirror and now they're paying for it.. literally.",6946,"Absolutely.

0,6994,Why aren't you telling anyone?,6995,"My family is very judgmental and negative.  If I don't do things by their recommendations, they will twist my independent happy moments into bad things.

They might be happy about it but be very overbearing and gossipy.  They insist on big celebrations for everything regardless of what he or I want and we don't like to bring a lot of attention to ourselves in that way.  Our friends would be disappointed that there wasn't a big celebration where they could be invited.

Peace, Love and Happiness to you both. ❤️",6999,"I got married to my best friend a few weeks ago , we announced a week or so later and everyone was sort of pissed that they weren't invited , but we could not have been happier.

We didn't have to spend a rediculess amount of money(we're saving for a home) , and we had the best time ever . 
Sometimes not dealing with the stress of an event is so much better than  accommodating to other peoples wants and needs. 

I hope you have an amazing life together and cheers !!",7000,Agreed.,7001,This is so cool. My SO and I are in a similar boat- our parents are totally different and don't get along. Telling them about the marriage (we are discussing we haven't done it yet) would cause all kinds of annoying attention/uproar. Our plan is to go to the courthouse and just do the job.

Don't know if this helps, but remember that parenthood is a joint effort. There might be certain things you can't handle right now with your 1 year old that your husband can, but isn't that a good thing if you think about it? You helping each other out? There will be things only you can handle in the future. 

And 1 year-olds are difficult. They can be monsters! I don't know a single parent with a 1 year old (especially not the first one) that rides on pink fluffy clouds, so to speak ;) They all love their kids, but they all say it's ""sooooo goooood to finally get out for a while"". ",7065,I love my kid and my husband dearly but we certainly have a strong willed and stubborn child. It's been a struggle in itself just learning how to teach him that he won't get his way all the time. My husband has the patience of Job to be able to deal with my shortcomings and mental illness and a stubborn child; I admire him for that. Parenting is certainly one of the most difficult things we have been through as a couple and I can't imagine doing it with anyone else. I just hope I'm making the right move and that it will get easier from here.,7066,"It will. It will get easier. First mama you need to do some self care. You are ok. You will get better.

It means so much to hear this even from a stranger. Thank you.",7070,"My therapist has taught me so much over the past two years, but the most important thing she taught me was to be kind to myself, since I'm so much harder on myself than I would be to someone else in my situation. She taught me to acknowledge that I have some serious issues and that I fight those issues every day instead of giving up. To give myself the credit I deserve for attempting, even if I sometimes fail. To recognize that seeking help when I need it shows courage and resourcefulness, not weakness. 

Never think that you failed because you couldn't handle your BPD on your own. You *are* handling it on your own. You decided on your own that you need help, and you are taking the steps to get that help. You aren't a mental health professional, and you *can't* do it on your own without seeking assistance from one. 

Would you consider an accomplished athlete to be a failure because they used a personal trainer to coach them, and went to a nutritionist to find out what their body needed to perform at its best? If they get injured, would you expect them to forego physical therapy and pain medication? Would it make their successes any less ""theirs"" to rely on those with more knowledge to guide them?   

Your brain is just another body part that needs training and occasionally suffers injuries. There is no shame in seeking treatment - it shows that you're taking responsibility for your health. Do this for yourself; you need to stick around for your son and your husband, but you also need to stick around for YOU. You deserve the chance to watch your son grow up and to grow old together with your husband, and you deserve to be happy and healthy while you do it. 

Congratulations on your first step toward that future! Be kind and congratulate yourself as well, on this step and every step you take. Be compassionate with yourself when you falter, and give yourself credit for having the guts to keep going. Finally, remember that others like myself think you're brave and strong for fighting, even if you don't always see it that way. ",7071,"Thank you so much. It's so hard to remember that self care doesn't always mean selfishness and that I need to mean something to myself as well as to those around me, this is one of those times where I need to be reminded the most. ",7072,"Self care *never* means selfishness. You can't take care of anyone else unless you take care of yourself first, especially not your husband or your child.",7073,"I would add too that sticking around for someone else, at least for me, was actually detrimental - I felt trapped and eventually resentful of the people who cared about me. If they cared so much, wouldn't they prefer I no longer be suffering? So doing it for myself became the only way to recover."
0,7212,"The best you can do right now is work around the kids. Get someone to watch them a couple evenings so you can spend time with your husband or get a manicure. Treat yourself to some nice underwear. Maybe not as often as before but sometimes. Leave the kids with their grandparents and go on a holiday just with your husband. Have sex everywhere again. It doesn't have to be black and white. You don't want to feel like you sacrificed something. This won't do any good to you nor the children. Trust me, I was an accident and always felt like my mom regretted me - it's not a great feeling. Try to squeeze out as much for yourself as you can. We only have this one life. ",7213,"Same but opposite here.  Oopsie baby as well.  Mom was nearly 40.    
  
My parents changed their lives as much as they had to for me.... but not more.  They didn't become mom & dad and nothing else.  And I never noticed.  I just knew that we did different stuff.  Went to a lot of museums and operas.  Not many play dates or water parks.  I was mad that I didn't get to go to Disney, but you know what?  San Francisco was pretty great too.  And I LIKED spending weekends at my grandma's house.    
  
What they did for me was... they moved to suburbia.  But when I was 11 they said ""wait, fuck this"" and moved where they actually wanted to be.  And my life was different.... but not worse.  You never know what could have been.  At 26 I don't really care that I was put in a shitty school after being yanked from a magnet/charter program.  It doesn't matter, essentially.  In my life. 
  
",7215,"Thing is, this sounds pretty specific to your situation…not really generally applicable advice.

In terms of free time, homeschooling makes a HUGE difference. You wouldn’t just be waking up earlier for school as someone else mentioned, but your child would likely be involved in more in a lot more social activities (OP’s examples were football, ballet, etc). Your copious free time also seems dependent on having a Grammy/Papa that are around, available, and willing to take the kids for long breaks (plus take them on trips). That DEFINITELY is not common.

Plus, from a financial perspective, it sounds like you’re fortunate enough to be in a position where only one parent is working (you said you homeschool full time), yet you can comfortably afford raising two kids, engaging in your own personal hobbies, buying clothes and comfort items for yourselves, etc.

In other words, its great that you’re able to live your own lives while also raising kids, but that seems in large part due to circumstances not widely available to others. For people whose kids attend school, where both parents need to work, who don’t have extremely accommodating grandparents to take the children for long periods of time, this advice is just not feasible nor particularly helpful.

EDIT: Not to say your general message of ""work with your spouse and your situation to find time for yourselves"" isn't great, but your detailed personal examples just don't seem helpful for OP's issues.",7216,"You homeschool though. Otherwise you'd be waking up at the ass crack of dawn every weekday. At least that's how I remember life as a school aged kid. Everything else sounds spot on and realistic for the general population though, I think. Coming from someone without kids who couldn't be a stay at home mom.",7219,What thread did you read? ,7220,"I think a lot of parents feel this way. It's a taboo subject to be honest about so it's something rarely discussed. My sister was 40 and had a baby with a complete idiot that ruined the life she had before. Now she says, ""at least I have my son."" I think it's complete bullshit. She went from a state job and owning her own business to welfare. That's an extreme example, but you're a human being with human emotions. It's ok to feel how you feel.",7221,"Daaamn, can kids REALLY mess your life up that bad though? Maybe in US where healthcare and time off for families is not provided? Idk... ",7222,"It was a combination of lots of things. The kid's dad is an idiot, the kid has some special needs, bad decisions on her part, and she was left holding the bag for everything.",7223,"Yes it's bad in America.  For the vast majority, both parents have to work full time jobs to have a normal quality of life.  Maternity leave is far from guranteed.  Vacation time is even less so.  Prices for basic staples keep going up while wages stagnate.  Public schools generally are worse than not good, they are a detriment to children.  ",7224,Agreed with you up until that last sentence. Public schools are very dependent on their location aka rich community = richer/better schools. The public school system I was in was very good because I was in a very rich county. This is why having schools funded locally is kind of shitty because it creates such a huge gap in education.,7225,"Yes the US makes it very difficult and expensive... No daycare, no support, maternity leave is iffy. I could go on and I  but it's too depressing.

0,7476,"Damn. I'm in a very similar situation. I also have bad teeth and I'm super self conscious and embarrassed about them. I never smile and constantly hide my face when I laugh. I'm really embarrassed to bring it up to my husband, and I'm also SUPER embarrassed and nervous about seeing a dentist (I've only gone a couple times in my life). I also have absolutely no idea what the cost will be to fix my teeth, so that's also something that's holding me back. But I know I have to go through with it soon, or risk losing my teeth in the future. You just gave me some courage to go through with it though, I'll try to make an appointment ASAP. ",7477,"I understand. Trust me. I was absolutely petrified and ashamed to bring it up to my husband. As if telling him about it would make it real. I was also terrified and ashamed at the thought of a dentist seeing the state of my poor teeth. When I posted on this sub the other day, I heard from a lot of people who are/were in very similar situations, or have loved ones in the same boat as me, and their reassuring words gave me the courage to take the first steps. 
I've always had a fear of the dentist. I had bad experiences as a child, and couple that with an anxiety disorder, as well as depression since I lost my mother in 2016, I've been a mess. And over the last couple years, I've had a severe case of the ""fuck its"". 
But just by taking this first step, admitting to myself and my husband that I have a problem that needs dealing with, I tremendous weight has been lifted, and, for the first time in a LONG time, I feel motivation, confidence, and pride in myself for having the courage to finally acknowledge my issues. 
And if I'm feeling that way now, I can only imagine how much more pride and confidence I'll feel once my procedure is over. 

Tell your husband. If he's anything like mine, he'll be a massive support for you. You don't have to bear this alone any longer. My husband cried when I told him, simply because he realized how long I'd been worrying, suffering, and feeling alone. His reassurance and unconditional love is what gave me the courage to finally go and get the help that I need. Let your husband be your strength. I guarantee you that he'll want nothing more than to help you smile again. 

What's more, don't be ashamed of going to the dentist. All they care about is getting your teeth back on track, and keeping it that way. My husband informed my dentist of my anxieties and the shame I'd been feeling beforehand, and everyone at his office was incredibly reassuring and considerate of my feelings. It was traumatic at first, but once I was told that I wouldn't lose any teeth, the shame, immense fear, and guilt that I'd felt for years drained away. 

As for payment, a lot of dentists will work with you on payment plans, as well as offering care credit. Once you tell your husband and come up with a plan of action, call around to different offices and ask about payment plans. 

Do it soon, you don't have to bear this alone any longer. You deserve to be able to proudly smile again.

Good luck!",7478,Thank you so much for your encouraging reply! I've already talked to my husband about it and I already feel a little bit better.

",7487,That is wonderful I went back to the dentist last year after 7 years of not going I was so nervous (I also have an anxiety disorder) but it wasn't as terrible as expected. While I had to have 2 teeth extracted they were wisdom teeth that probably should have been removed long ago. I still have to go get my fillings (have to make appointments once a month so that I can pay for the work instead of all the money at once) but am otherwise all set now and just have to get the cleanings every 6 months,7488,"OMG YAY! I was hoping you'd get some nice resolution to this, and I'm so happy that you have.",7489,"Thank you so much! 
I can't tell you how relieved I am. I feel like a real person again, and that this massive weight has been lifted. I know I still have a bit of a journey ahead of me, but just knowing that I get to keep every single tooth in my head has me feeling so incredibly happy that I feel I could burst!

Normally, I think it's kind of shitty to be constantly suspicious of anyone who's done time, always assuming they're going to do it again the first minute they get a chance.  But in this particular case, fuck that.  This guy raped a *child* for years and years.  He doesn't deserve to be trusted, ever again.  The safe thing *is* to assume he'll do it again as soon as the opportunity is there.  You may be completely wrong, but this is not something you take risks with.  If he didn't want people to treat him like a pedophile and take their daughters out of the room, he shouldn't have raped a kid.",7539,"This all happened today so I'm reeling. I have had some time to reflect though. Sally always asked if any kids would be present at any party she was invited to, under the guise of ""Maybe I can bring my nephew"" and as soon as you said yes, she would say ok. And then 15 minutes later she called back to say they couldn't make it. It never occurred to me there was a connection.

She also sat there one day while I cried about finding out I am infertile and she was so kind and sympathetic saying she couldn't have them either. I get it now. 

I realize in her way she is trying to help, and I don't know how I feel about that. So I'm trying super hard to reconcile this situation with a friendship that I don't know can survive the past. 

She asked if we can meet up to talk. I assume it's about this because I said nothing to her after my conversation with Jim. I don't know if I should.

I agreed to talk to Jim because my brother is a felon because he was a dumb 19 year old who stole some beer and punched a guy on the way out the door. He's now 45 and his life is hard as a result. He is still paying for it by having fewer job opportunities and the like. So I sympathized, assuming it was something similar. 

Ugh.",7541,"No kill IF POSSIBLE?  You're fucking me.

TIL it's okay to kill an animal because it's owners are bad people and you don't want to talk to them for the 2 minutes it takes to give their pet back.

The dog did nothing, it doesn't deserve the trauma of being separated from everything it knows yet again and put in a cage and potentially killed.  I'm glad OP is a better person than you.  

Go ahead and feel offended, I don't care.  What you're suggesting is horrible and incredibly, insanely selfish.

He is trained very well, playful, healthy, intelligent and an all-around great dog. He has had a great life thus far. And he is also totally safe and healthy and happy with me.

I agreed early this morning to adopt him permanently anyway so it's a non-issue.

Calling animal control and paying a surrender fee to abandon a healthy dog who did nothing wrong isn't going to happen. I'm not a perfect person but I am a woman of my word.

I would watch the dog but keep my distance from them. Slow down responses to texts and decline invitations. I don't know what her reasons are for staying with him, maybe she feels that she can keep him from reoffending or something.",7552,"I don't know either. Based on our conversation early this morning, I assume Sally knows I know. She asked if she can meet me later to talk and if I can keep the dog permanently. I agreed to both as I love the dog and because I feel like it's the right thing to do to let Sally say what she needs to say."
0,7615,"I just want to thank you all, I'm meeting my friend in an hour to talk, at first I was thinking on not ruining their day but to hell with it, I need to know the truth
I will be back to update",7616,Please let us know. ,7617,"Dear Reddit friends 
I met with my friend, I talk to her and explained the whole ordeal, she was actually happy that I reached out to her, she knows how much I hate cheaters, when I was a child I walked in on my Dad cheating on my Mom with the help. 
I apologized to my friend and I made her listen to the whatsapp messages, she was really sad that I would think for a second that she would be capable of sleeping with my husband but as I said, she understood my anger and mistrust.
She told me that she actually had sex with my brother in law a few times and even the night before he got married they were together until 7, I know she's not lying because my in laws could not locate him till 7:30 am and everyone was worried that he would be a no show that day.
I apologized to my friend, and then I called my in laws  to explain to them that I will never speak to their son ever again, I'm not giving him a second chance to ever hurt me, I don't care if he goes from being a druggie to becoming a preacher, he made me think the worse of my husband and hurt my family.
I don't think that my husband is a saint but he really has put his family first as he pointed out.
As for my sister in law, I'm done with her too because in the messages she's heard laughing in the background, I will not tell her about his infidelity because she made her bed she can lay in it, and I don't want to hurt her the way I was hurt today.
As for my husband, I'm in the kitchen as I write this preparing his favorite meal and I will apologize to him for being so rude and disrespectful, he and our daughter are the best things in my life.
Sorry for the long post, thanks for listening, since I've found Reddit 6 months ago I really do enjoy people and their different points of views. Thanks again and Happy New Year.

Even by the actions she admitted to, this person is not your friend. Out of everyone in this story, the least trustworthy person is not the brother-in-law, but your ""friend"".

Your friend still isn’t a good person. ,7627,What do you think of your friend's characters now that you know she cheated with a man on his wedding day? 
0,7691,Thank you. He fought for a long time. I miss him so much but I can at least be happy he's not in pain anymore.,7692,"OP, my sincere condolences on your brother's passing. He wrote a beautiful, heartfelt, and introspective letter to you and your family. I, too suffer from depression, so I get where he was coming from, but having lost someone most dear to suicide, I also understand how you are feeling. To offer you some food for thought, when someone is dying from a disease like cancer, we all rally around, hold the patient's hand, pray for them, and reassure them. With depression, when it truly becomes too much, because of the stigma, we are outraged when the patient dies. I know this, as did your brother. Please forgive him. He did the very best he could, and his letter is witness that he wanted to cause as little hurt to you and your family as possible. May he rest in peace, and may you and your family be comforted. Sending you love and hugs, Virginia",7693,"Thank yoh, Virginia. He was a beautiful person. I just wish he could have seen it for himself.",7694,"Sweetheart, he will always be a beautiful person, and he knows it now. The important thing for you to remember is he didn't want his death to destroy you. Grieve for however long you need to, but know that the cause of his death wasn't by his hand, he died from a  disease called depression. Please give yourself some time, and then get some grief counseling. What happened to your brother is grievous beyond words, but I know in my heart that he is with you, looking out for you, and will never leave you. Love is like that. It never ends. You are in my heart, and I will keep you in my meditations. ",7695,I'll be strong for him. I'm going to dedicate my life to fighting this disease in his memory. ,7696,"Be strong for your brother, but please be gentle with yourself. You can do a lot of good on your brother's behalf, but don't give up on your own dreams, on your own goals, on your own loves. You do not have to adopt his illness as your cause. Speak about it, write about it, but don't give up on your own life. You have places to go, people to see, and one day, great laughs to be had. ",7697,"I never really had a passion before now. I became a lawyer because of the status and because I knew I could earn a good loving. I never really cared, though. My brother has given me a cause to fight for. He's given me a true purpose.

Sexual compatibility is so important and I'm not sure this particular marriage could work out with such a disparity between their sex drives.",7752,"I wasn't suggesting that she suppress or seek compromise. Therapy is a safe place to get it out, and no therapist worth a dime would tell her to hold it all in.

1. You seem like a good parent! 
2. I was like this when I was a child, I turned out pretty well. I have mild motivation issues but they stem from many different things. I think your child will more than likely grow up to be a normal functioning adult. It might be helpful to try to instill a good work ethic in him, in some form. Either way, try not to let it worry you too much. 

Power to ya! Keep up the good parenting!",7910,"A good teacher who understands every type of child and not just the “good” child is something amazing. I wish you luck, you sound like an awesome parent!",7911,"That’s awesome! I can only imagine the feeling! Your son probably feels completely differently about school now too. 
I hope your son continues to thrive with teachers who provide an environment in which he feels comfortable, it makes such a huge difference. He’s blessed to have parents like you as well who have been there to support him.",7912,"I work with kids and from your story it seems like your son was bored at school. It might be the case that he is, or al least a bit, highly intelligent or that he has ADD or ADHD, or that he is on the autism spectrum.

It can show up in different ways and not just the classic hyperactive type. I would look more into this, anxiety can be a comobidity as well",7916,"Just out of curiosity, could he fall into a gifted category? If teachers are always mentioning he’s smart, likes the company of older children, has high emotional needs and can solve math problems efficiently..  perhaps he needs more of a challenge than what he’s being offered in school. 

Some food for thought! Gifted children tend to slip through the cracks in public schools. ",7918,"Trust me, a teacher with an open mind on how to deal with all kinds of children is worth their weight in gold. My nephew spent 3rd grade miserable and my sister constantly having to fight for his rights. 4th grade was heaven compared to 3rd.

0,7931,STOP giving diet/exercise advice. Support the op with her relationship issue only.,7932,"800 is unhealthy and most adults should be aware of that. Your husband seems to care too much, more than you, about your appearance.",7933,Yea right. Tell *him* to eat 800 calories a day for a month and get back to you. Plus if you want to lose weight you should do it for you not for him. That's my two cents ,7934,"800 calories/day was my absolute *maximum* amount of calories I would allow myself to eat in a day, back when I had an eating disorder. If I consumed even one calorie more than that (I was obsessive about calories, an often overestimated my intake on purpose so I'd guarantee myself consuming less than my ""maximum"") I would go back myself throw up. 

However, most days I'd aim to keep it under 600 calories. 

Point is, him wanting you to eat 800 calories a day, as well as exercise along with that is quite dangerous, and if he cares about you and your health at all he would never dream of asking you to do this.

0,8060,"My mother is driving a wedge between my sister and me and using guilt to do it. She'll feed my sister shit about how i don't care about her. To hear this from your 6 year old sister fucking breaks your heart. I told her I got a job today, doing something she's been nagging me to do for years even though I never wanted to. No congratulations, no thanks. Just a ""why didn't you help pay for the mother's day present? I've taken money out of your sisters bank account to help your brother out."" 

Last year I was fucking bending backwards helping her out when I had a job. Extra money for groceries? I topped up. Needed fuel for the car? I paid for it. But ALL of that goes out the window this year. I'm a disappointment. I'm ""the worst parts of myself"" and the reason she doesn't get her hopes up. I'm living at home because i'm scared if I leave they won't be able to keep the house without the money I pay in rent. I can't leave this toxic hell hole and she DOESN'T. GET. IT.

She hasn't seen me cry in years and she no longer gets that right ",8063,"I totally agree with you. At 16, my mother had a breakdown and began taking her frustrations out on me. After enduring her yelling at me for no reason other than because she could, my dad suggested I moved out and went to live with my girlfriend of the time.

She proceeded to get herself sectioned, at which point she was diagnosed as bipolar. She thought she was fine and stopped taking her medication the moment she got out, and went straight back to square one. My father separated from her, and she made things incredibly messy - rather than split for a short while and see how things went, she moved to London and demonized Dad for ruining their marriage. They divorced.

Eventually she was sectioned for a second time, after discovering that Dad had moved on and found a new partner. She flipped out. Having alienated everyone else in her immediate family, she made me her next of kin - just as I was starting my first job. I couldn't handle it, and she dragged me even deeper into depression at a time I should have been focused on getting my life together after dropping out of university.

She proceeded to alienate everyone who disagreed with her - her brother, her parents, her childhood friend of whom she had moved in with in London - until eventually she had no contact with anyone. Good riddance, I say. She dragged the entire family into depression, which I only came to realize the beginning of this year. Mine cost me my degree, numerous jobs, a six year relationship and most of my hobbies.

0,8083,"I’m on the other side of this, my fiancé lost his wife to ovarian cancer when she was only 28, they accidentally had a son when they were barely out of high-school. I adore their son who is now a teen and I raise him like my own except I missed all the little years. I cry a few times a month without anyone knowing because I get to watch HER son grow and I wonder if I’m good enough to her even though I know I am personally doing my best. My fiancé only gets upset about once a month in front of me but I hate it when he hides it, I completely get it and do not feel jealous or like I’m 2nd in any way. Life is filled with so many paths and no one deserves to be lonely. And just because you’re with a new person having a kid does not mean you don’t love the other person or miss them. Where his son hangs out most I have pictures of them up as a family because I don’t want either of them to suppress their feelings or forget. It was hard for them to look at first but now I think it’s more of a symbol to them of strength and they feel like they have a guardian angel. I think when someone know they are going to pass being remembered like that for them is so important. ",8084,"My mother died when I was seven.  My father remarried my stepmother when I was ten.

0,8131,Get a babysitter for a night and go get a massage. Or have a friend or parent watch them. You need a break take one ,8133,Lmfao chill.,8134,"I was pretty much non-verbal until I was almost 4. My parents did the same as you, spent thousands on speech therapy for me but it didn’t work. I cried constantly as a toddler and would never sleep or settle. And If I got hurt, instead of telling my parents (because I couldn’t) I would just hold my breath until my lips and face would go blue. I couldn’t verbally communicate so I came up with other ways to communicate that may have been perceived as not ‘neurotypical’

My parents were told I would never be able to speak properly and they even received a disability pension for me for a while.

A very clever doctor decided to check my ears and it turns out I had severe ear problems and was always in pain there, but basically I couldn’t hear properly (I wasn’t deaf per se), which is why I never spoke.

Now I’m almost 27 and have a speaking speed that could rival the Gilmore Girls, and my ears are completely fine. 

Try to get yourself a night off to clear your head and switch off. Then maybe try and find a new doctor and get another opinion. Hang in there, OP. I hope there’s a light at the end of the tunnel for you. ",8135,"I had a similar problem. I had a bunch of fluid in my ears so I just couldn't hear properly. Since I couldn't hear I obviously couldn't speak, and your inner ear affects balance so I walked late. I hit a bunch of milestones late, was always at physical therapy, speech therapy, etc. I cried every Sunday because I didn't want to go back to school. Honestly I was a fucking mess. I would end up is the hospital fairly frequently (for a hospital visit) because of my asthma. My mom did so much for me it's ridiculous. I'm not saying that OP's son will necessarily be the same way, it might be more serious, but there's a real chance it will work out in the end. I like to think I'm a pretty normal kid now and I like the person I've become because of my upbringing and all of the problems I worked through. I can't imagine how fucking stressful it must have been for my mom, but now that it's over she knows how much I appreciate everything she does. ",8136,Check the ears OP!

0,8218,"About 7-8 years ago, my grandma made me a promise that if I could get and stay clean for 5 years, she would take me to the store and buy me the best flat screen TV... in late April '11, I found out I was pregnant, but having been an active addict (DOC was opiates) for the previous 10 years, I knew there was no way I could be a parent, let alone a good one, so I never told anyone. June 5 '11, my grandma suddenly passed away, her funeral was the same day, same time as my Dr appt to discuss my options with termination... I chose to go to her funeral, then I chose to get clean and decided I couldn't not have the child. December 11, my perfectly healthy happy perfect son was born. The day my son was born, I chose to start the clock... and until December 2016, I *never* owned a flatscreen TV... but Dec 15th 2016, I went and bought the biggest, best 55in 4k TV and the absolute best surround sound system I could find... my now-5-year-old son and I set everything up together and then I sat there and cried for 2-3 hours because she passed away never knowing I was pregnant and never having seen me clean/sober and *actually happy*...

I know how hard this shit is... even after 5 years, I know how hard it STILL is... most people don't understand just what an achievement it really is, how crushingly hard it can be... but you've made it this far, don't let anyone/anything stop you from reaching 6th, 8th, 10th, 20th year...

I thought that fentanyl was a deadly opiate or something, so how does a patch work?",8226,"I put a patch on my skin. It's the size of the bandage part of a regular bandaid. It releases fentanyl in tiny amounts - 12 micrograms per hour - for continuous pain relief. After 72 hours, I put a new patch on my other upper arm. 

Ibwas fed up with oxy, and read about buprenorphine (suboxone) patches being quite helpful, but my insurance covers the fentanyl patches.

And yes, fentanyl is about 100X more potent than morphine, making it a deadly drug to add to heroin or to take in large amounts, which is why having it in patch form is so helpful.",8227,Thank you! ,8230,That is a massive undertaking. Good for you.

As a recovering addict, I salute you and hope that I manage to reach the point you're at too.  There's something so magical about getting clean after spending a long period addicted.  It's almost like being sober is the new high.  It's so different and new, and incredibly fulfilling.

It's been almost 3 years since I decided to get sober, and I've only had 1 major slip-up.  It's been a hard road.  I decided to go to an inpatient facility and spent 4 weeks learning about how addiction affects the brain physiologically, and most importantly how to control the cravings."
0,8250,That's exactly what I was thinking. If your kids are so fucking delightful why are you trying so hard to get away from them??,8251,"Well sounds like they aren't really friends then, they are leaches (harsh but true). I get wanting a date night and I get that a special needs kid can be a handful but they have absolutely no right to expect you to watch their kids free of charge. At the very least they should offer a bottle of (insert your prefered alcohol here) and to order dinner for you. You are perfectly within your rights to say ""No"". They are parents, time for them to act like it and improvise for date nights.",8252,"Holy shit, good fucking riddance! You may never know the ""joy"" (if we're going to be calling it this...) of looking after these psychos' children, but I think you've been blessed with an even better joy which is being free of these crazies in your life. 

The only selfish people in this story are those parents. You did nothing wrong. How dare they *expect* someone that they don't even know very well to babysit three kids, to which one of them has a severe intellectual disability to the point where he's in diapers at age 7, **for free** just so they can have a date night. The world doesn't owe you anything because you ended up with a handicapped child. When you decide to have kids, you have to weigh the risks of possibly having a child with special needs...which is always going to be more of a strain on your resources than children without such disabilities. 

Those parents are delusional morons. Your whole friend group is smart to abandon them. ",8253,"Well said. Did these people not realize that this is what they signed up for when they chose to have three kids? (Referring to the no alone time part, not necessarily the special needs although that is always a risk)",8254,"And to be absolutely honest, the oldest kid is handicapped, they could've just skipped on having *two* other babies. So they knew well enough about the handicap risk and still went ahead (usually if you have a handicapped child (when talking about autism and similar), it means your next ones are in higher risk, if I remember correctly).",8255,They probably wanted do-over kids. These parents sound like blundering idiots. ,8256,"Do-over kids sound even worse... The only ""redeeming"" thing here is they didn't dispose of their handicapped son :/",8257,I'm not sure if he's better off with parents who seem like they don't really want him. ,8258,"We're about to try for kids and it terrifies me to think about an extremely special needs kids. Taking L and J's point of view, I get it, essentially your life is no longer your own. It's consumed by the child's needs and in some cases they will never ever mentally be adults. They will continuously need you to help them for the remainder of their lives. But, on the other hand, expecting others to take on your burden and spurn them if they refuse is not OK. I would be goddamn petrified if someone asked me to take care of an extremely autistic 7 year old boy alone. You did the right thing in refusing them and they suck for treating you that way. My empathy though tells me they are hurting bad and need help, but are going about it in a blundering and self destructive way. I pretty much never ever comment on Reddit, but your story struck a chord. Good luck to you :)",8259,"I had the exact same reactions. I do feel terrible for them in that a special needs child can be an incredible burden, but at the same time, how dare they *shame* other people like that? damn.

Great!  

Please do post on the aftermath.  Each.  Gory.  Tooth gnashing. Fingernails on chalkboard.

0,8436,"I don't know what you mean by your child suffering losses in infancy, but infantile amnesia is real--children don't remember stuff from infancy, so unless you severely neglected or abused him, he has no lasting impacts of anything from that period. He's not going to be any more affected by divorce than any other kid.

Your husband needs help. You and your child should not be living in this environment. Your husband is setting a horrible example for your child, and by putting up with this behavior, you're sending a message to your child that it's acceptable. Leave. Now. Divorce or not, you need to get your kid out of there.

",8437,"Completely agree here. Studying neuroscience here, there's no way if your kid was in ""early infancy"" he remembers anything like that.",8438,"Thank you for sharing. That must be really hard to live with. I understand your desire to keep the family together for your child, but in the long term, having a depressed mother, vs the person that you would be if you weren't with your husband, has its good sides too. I had a relationship once where I was working on myself and my partner stopped, and it felt like we grew apart very quickly. We didn't have kids so it was a lot different to go separate ways, but my gut kept saying something was off. Wishing you the best of luck on whatever path you choose in this ",8439,"That sounds like an awful situation.

You talk about body shaming in one paragraph and being made into the enemy in another. Being mean for the sake of it because of his weight wouldn't be cool, but talking to him about your legitimate issues with his smell is not body shaming. You are not his enemy just for bringing up his weight, he needs to stay hygienic no matter what size he is. This kind of struck a chord with me, I know what it's like to be made into the enemy by someone I love.

It's not your fault, you're not being silly, and it's not a thing you should just have to ""get over"". This is a very real issue for you both physically and mentally, and you deserve to be listened to and taken seriously.

I hope things work out for you and your 7 year old, OP.",8441,"I have to second this and not lightly. My ex husband was smelly. His bosses would bring it up. He was even dismissed from a job over it. The actual offense was something else but so transparent we knew the real why. He would cycle through hygiene patterns from wouldn't shower for days to he's a sexy beast when cleaned up. 
When we sperated it was hard, I moved into a less than ideal apartment and struggled financially for about a year. 
I'm sad my marriage ended but I'm over the moon about the results.
I'm happy for the first time in so so long I woke up feeling OK. No bull no issue no manbaby to take care of. Then to my ex. He cleaned up our marriage home to the way it was before he checked out. His hygiene took an up swing. He does karate now and is fit and active. It's amazing to see. Sadly if he had done those things for me we would have worked out, but I'll take seeing him happy and separate. Without me as his crutch ,the buffer in between him and the world, he grew up. 
So maybe you will give him the gift of life. Even if he doesn't benefit you and your child should. He's young now what will his life be like in a few years? Will he bring friends home? If he does will they make fun of him for having the stinky house? Will dad be there for the big moments? Will your child want him to be? Be strong. It's a big scary world out there and having a partner makes it so much more enjoyable. Whatever you decide I have faith in you.  ",8442,"I'm so sorry you have to deal with this. It seems like your husband has no respect for himself, you or anyone else. I wish I had some advice for you. I hope you find a way to happiness in the future. No one should have to live this way.",8443,"It seems to me like he is suffering from some major depression and self-esteem issues. When you ask him to clean himself better, it's creating a new level of anxiety for himself where he feels even more like a failure. Sometimes the best way for a person who is that depressed to realize they need to make a change is to realize it themselves. When you are making comments to him about his appearance or smell, it is going to add to his ""pile of shit"" internally about himself. He needs to sift through that himself to align his priorities correctly and realize that he isn't doing something basic like taking care of himself. 
I have some suggestions that I hope will make a difference, and yes, they are going to cost money, but shouldn't be more than a therapy session cost. 
-remove all the toilet paper and buy only flushable wipes, (the BS about them clogging up pipes is false, yes you need to only flush one at a time, but they disintegrate just like toilet paper). They are a little more expensive, so I recommend going to costco or Sams club for them, to buy in bulk. You can get a 10 pack for $12-15. They clean much better than toilet paper and most people only need one wipe per poop session. They encourage you to keep cleaning until you swipe and the wipe comes back clean. 
-take him to the store (just you two) and spend time in the men's body wash area. Before going, tell him to find something new he really really likes, whatever the price, and tell him you want him to get it because you love him and care about him. Make the experience about him, and what he likes, make sure to not influence your choice at all, but you can share the smells you both like back and forth. Make sure that you are passive in this experience so it is enjoyable for him. Once he chooses a new body wash, make sure he also gets a loofah, and a new deodorant (I recommend the newer lines of old spice, they aren't very expensive compared to others and they smell very good). If he's really feeling it, keep going by getting him a new toothbrush, and some pomade for his hair (if he has it). You're doing this to get him to build his confidence, so if something seems too much, reel it back in. 
-next, get a detachable shower head. You can buy one for less on Amazon if you're able to. Otherwise Walmart will do. They influence people to rinse and thoroughly rinse everywhere including their nether regions. Rather than the traditional shower head, which would require you to stand, bend over, spread your cheeks and let the water drip down your crack to rinse it out. 
-if he has hair and it's time for a haircut, take him to a hip barbershop, have him pick out a haircut he likes out of some new styles. And have the barber/stylist teach him how to use the pomade to do that style everyday at home. Remember to keep this about him, so try to remain passive, so it doesn't seem forced and you're wanting to do this just for him. 

Now... every day that he uses all the new hygiene products and is excellent in hygiene, shower him with compliments, maybe give him a bj right out of the shower when possible. If he lapses, don't acknowledge it, and don't be overtly affectionate. He will get it on his own, without getting offended or more depressed. When he is using the products and being excellent in hygiene make comments about how you love how great he smells, how handsome he is, and how happy he is. Don't mention that he is showering, don't mention that he is taking care of himself. If you do this, this creates an expectation for him, and when he doesn't do it, he will have anxiety build up and ultimately lapse and start the problems all over again. You can mention how proud you are of him later in a few months when his confidence has built back up, but in the beginning he is going to be very fragile and sensitive. Only focus on positive reinforcement of good behavior by complimenting his smell when he takes care of himself. Don't acknowledge his bad behavior and don't call it out. But it will be known because he will ultimately realize showering and better hygiene=happier me, compliments, blowjobs, and a happy wife. ",8444,"I'll second the handheld shower head, it makes a tremendous difference when it comes to being able to really clean between the legs, especially with a person that is larger or has mobility/flexibility troubles. They're not expensive and really easy to switch out, they just screw in. It's the first thing I buy when I move in to a new place.",8445,"Flushable wipes that are Costco brand are harder to flush, but brands like Cottonelle or even the Target house brand are flushable. The downside is that they are much smaller. ",8446,"Perhaps consider getting a detachable shower head if you don't already. When he DOES shower, should make it easier for him to wash and reach more thoroughly.",8447,"Oh god, this sounds horrible.

I'm so sorry you're going through this. And do, please, get yourself away before the whole thing breaks you. All my best wishes.",8448,"Hiya, I'm sorry about this hard time your going through. 

Your husband dose seem quite depressed, and I saw a good post below about tips of encouraging his good hygiene. 
However I know what it's like to be severely depressed, your self esteem and everything that goes with (hygiene,motivation
...) all goes to shit. 
The one thing that always helps make an effort no matter how shit I feel is my partner. I know that it's not right for me to not try for her and expect her to put up with it.
He needs to communicate with you, from what you said he makes you feel bad, (you say your body shaming him, and he brings up his bad past) if you try and communicate his hygiene issues. And he's just not trying at all.

Try the soft way first with lost of compliments and such for when he tries, but remember he's not your responsibility, if he's still not trying it you might have to lay down the law with him.
And then worse case scenario I think you already know what that is.

Best of luck too you, and remember that you have the right to be happy.

You will realize that her happiness is enough to get you through it! Heres my advice... go buy some ice cream (or your favorite junk food snack) and just chow down after she leaves (food has been proven to reduce anxiety if only for a little bit so it could maybe pick you up a bit)! after that, it sounds like you have a lot going on that will make you get through this process with as little pain as possible which makes me really happy to hear!

My mom is an abusive relationship and she is so lonely and my siblings just take advantage of her I feel. It breaks my heart every time I talk to her. I feel guilty for moving away because I feel like I abandoned her.

I hand knitted her a baby blanket and don’t think I’ll be giving it to her anymore. My husband and I will stay friends with her husband, but I don’t think either of us want to be around his wife again. Hearing her name right now makes my skin crawl. ",8623,"I know what you mean. It’s not the same, but I can relate because my mom had a miscarriage, and as she was in the hospital hooked up to a bunch of wires and still not recovered, her “friends” came into the room to “meet her” and when they came in they started talking about JCP deals to each other, completely ignoring my mom. After a few minutes, I couldn’t bear it and I told them to get the fuck out of the room.
I sometimes wonder how people can be so oblivious to another’s pain.",8624,"I'm sorry for what you've been through. I had an emergency c-section at week 34 due to pre-eclampsia and no, NICU is no fun and neither is having a teeny tiny baby which you cannot hold or bring home right away.

&#x200B;

Your ""friend"" is horrible. Pregnancy brain (aka the crazies) can't even explain her awful behavior. ",8625,"Yea it was definitely her regular ole stupid brain and not her pregnancy brain.  She’s youngish, but so am I. I think she thinks having a baby is having your own personal dress up doll. They got preggo on accident and we had to actively try for around 7 months. I think when I was in the hospital it was all anybody could talk about in town and so she may think there’s glamour in crisis. ",8626,"We succeeded after 2 years and 2 miscarriages, so when my friends get impatient after only trying for a month, I get upset but try not to take it personally... because it’s literally not about me.

And this isn’t about you either. It hurts when people are insensitive but often it’s not targeted at anyone in particular. People (especially pregnant ones) say silly stuff. Just avoid her and focus on your little one.

",8627,"Wow, she’s a real idiot for doing that. 

And I’m sorry that you had to go through such awful time and you’ve lost a baby. ",8628,"Yeah, I'd say F her and stay away from her. Seems like a complete asshole! ",8629,"If you don’t want to necessarily end the friendship with these people, you will have to at least be on guard. There will most likely be more of this type of vocal diarrhea coming out of her as your children grow up. For example, my kid has a speech delay, didn’t speak til 4, I was excited when he started saying certain phrases, another friend stomped on my excitement saying Oh, my LO has been saying that since she was 18 months!  No shit. ",8630,"The one uppers...
Just celebrate all children’s success! It’s a very easy concept that some find so difficult ",8631,"I know, right?  My kid got to go to “school” (speech therapy) when he was 2.5, and this same friend was like Why doesn’t MY kid get to start school?  Like their kid was missing out on educational opportunities. Smh. My kid’s autistic,  how jealous are they now, I wonder. ",8632,"I’d love you to say that so bluntly to them! Watch their faces drop. 
It must be so exhausting being so preoccupied with other people’s things though. I’m just having a quick reddit browse and a cuppa before the baby wakes. Where to other mums find the time to care about other people’s kids (in a nice way 😂) "

0,8745,"Unfortunately your situation is not uncommon in today’s society. Millions of people who seem to make a nice living are behind the eightball, over extended in credit, over drawn at the bank, cash poor, and having to constantly work to keep their heads above water. I’ve been there a couple times in my life, and it can be very discouraging, you must have the tenacity, grit, sand (insert your own adjective) to keep going. In some cases, if it gets totally overwhelming, bankruptcy is always an option. Life is surviving one catastrophe after another. I wish you the best, and hope things come around for you. ",8746,"Thanks, friend ",8747,❤️😊,8748,Well said.,8749,"Wait, what? You're broke because you and your husband keep starting businesses. Stop it. Being an entrepreneur is expensive; it's a luxury. This is the most 1st-world-problem, humblebrag, sheltered offmychest post I've ever seen.

You made more money as a receptionist because you worked a steady, un-glamorous job for regular pay and had minimal bills. Go do that again and you'll be fine. Most startups are destined to fail. Most startups (especially brick and mortar) require serious capital. You're not poor, you're just bad at business. Jesus, cry me a river. You probably still have a fat 401k.

I'm not sure how this isn't obvious - Reduce your bills and increase your income. If your businesses aren't successful, sell them. If you've started two and they're both failing then you're not cut out to be a business owner.

Sell the clothing store, don't run the brewery, get a gym membership, and focus on your high paying counseling.

Wow.",8750,"Seriously! She’s said the clothing store has been struggling since 2016 - why continue to operate a failing business? Plus she also seems unaware that the majority of food/beverage businesses take a minimum of a year to BREAK EVEN and even that is not a guarantee. A regular 9-5 isn’t exactly glamorous or following your passion, but if you’re struggling that much financially, it makes sense to get rid of at least one business and wait until you’re more financially stable. ",8751,"I believe they're trying to live outside the financial means also.. leave the brewery, clothing store and move into a cheaper home, watch your outcome. I've seen people get by and be happy all while doing a lot less than a full time job and running two companies..",8752,"How are the projections for the brewery? I'm not trying to criticize but there's a lot more to running a successful business than giving it a shot. I have worked with a lot of entrepreneurs as a CPA and I've seen more than a few people lose their shirt. I've also seen a lot of people make millions working for themselves and besides a huge work ethic (which you seem to have) I believe most of it comes down to planning.   

Of course there are exceptions but the vast majority successful entrepreneurs I know run ""boring"" businesses eg industrial fuel additives / home generator sales.   The people running businesses they're passionate about tend to be broke. ",8753,"How do people run a business without being passionate? I guess I’ve never ran something without being insanely invested in it. My mom’s a home builder who’s built a company from nothing to a million dollar gig, and my dad has his own thing day trading now. We’ve always worked for ourselves but I’ve never considered the possibility of running something boring because I don’t want to put everything into something I’m not wildly into. Maybe that’s where I’ve went wrong, strongly associating my self worth/sense of identity with my businesses. 

The brewery is projected to do really well. We’ve been in the market for a few years via contract brewing and the beer scene in our state is finally blossoming. Our response has held great for that time. By having the taproom we’re cutting our the distributor’s cut and making $6 on an approximately $.60 beer (to make) with crazy low overhead. My store’s overhead has been its demise. I think we’ve had the mentality of “life is too short to not follow your dreams” but DAMN. It’s the first time I’ve wrung my hands about making it. ",8754,"I work with one guy who followed his passion and now he has more money than anyone needs. His e-mail signature is something like that about following your dreams and it's kind of makes me chuckle because I know so many more people who left a six figure job to start their dream business only to lose their house.  
  
It's a tricky thing - on the one hand you do need passion. It takes a ton of motivation and drive to build something from nothing. The most successful people tend to have a passion for building businesses or making money, but most people aren't like that (thank god).  
  
Passion can hold you back in a couple of ways. The first one is like you said associating your self image with your business. I've been a musician for my whole life. I'm conservatory trained and I've played with many different groups. People often would ask me why I never pursued music as a career. I always tell them that I love it too much to sell it. I can't put a price tag on myself / my art.   
  
Passion can also be distracting. A lot of people talk about wanting to start a business to get away from the rat race and the dog eat dog corporate culture. In reality the marketplace is vastly more competitive and cutthroat than the typical office job. If you aren't 100% profit oriented in your business decisions, you will lose out to someone who is.   
  
You are right that life is short and many people go their whole lives missing out on the things they always wanted to do. I think it's best to look at a your first profitable business as a stepping stone as opposed to an end-game.   
  
One guy I know started a dull sounding business and gave it his all for a few years. Now that business nets about a million a year and he spends his time running a comic shop. He loses money every year running the comic shop but who cares because he has plenty of money and he loves doing it. ",8755,"I can relate, but slightly different causes.

I work full time in a field I've been trying to stay out of, and in fact returned to college to pursue a degree to STAY out of it.

Unfortunately in my community there aren't many good paying jobs. Rather than pick up a second job, (I barely see my wife and kids as it is each week), I fill up my downtime with volunteer work, nearly all of which other than a meeting here and there can be done from home.

I've vented a lot about the stress and the toll it takes on my mental health attempting to juggle so much at once, but I cant bring myself to pick up a part time job to replace the volunteer work. I may not get paid for it, but it provides me the little bit of fulfillment doing something that I know is important. Plus it'll put me in a better situation when I graduate.

I could be in a better financial situation if I did pick up a second job, but damnit, people shouldnt have to work 14 hour days just to pay their bills and have food on the table, and if I did, I'd be an unbearable ass, and would hate my life. That's no way to live, and wouldn't be fair to my wife whom also works full time, not our kids.

They need us too.

Best of luck in the future. I have a lot of experience in operating businesses and have been able to turn 3 different stores on a pathway to profitability. If my experience can help you in any way, I'd love to be able to. Different type of business, but the principals would be similar.",8756,"I went back to school in STEM to try to improve my financial situation, but am now realizing I probably would have been better off staying in retail; my increase in pay won’t offset my student loan payments, as things currently stand.

0,8770,"So sorry about your mother.   As for the selfish client,  well then.  Your mom is lucky to have you. ",8771,Thanks 😊,8772,"While I was taking care of my mom with stage 4 lung cancer,  she started to fall a lot at night getting up out of bed to go to the bathroom- one time so hard a quarter of her face swelled up and the bruise was horrible. 

No matter all the sadness at home, I was somehow really excelling at work. At the time, I worked for a bank and I won a bank wide customer service award.  My boss insisted I go to the event and accept the award when the event went  until 10 pm and was over 45 mins away. Seeing as how I was the sole caregiver for my mother, especially  during a period where she was prone to falling. there was no way this was happening. I couldn’t make it to the non-mandatory corporate event. 

After relaying such, my former boss called me into her office and told me “if you have time to go see your boyfriend on the weekend ( I had a slight arrangement with my brother to make this possible.. ) ...you have time to do this.” 

I put in my two weeks a week later. Un-be-fucking-liev-able.

If they want to have Thanksgiving or Christmas with her they could wait until after the actual day. ,8781,"I feel for you. Don't let it get to you and focus on caring and loving you mom. Let me share a similar personal story. 

My mom was diagnosed with stage four cancer about the same time I went to university. While attending I was working at a small, locally owned music store (it's a very rural community for a university town, and it's the only music store. It was just the boss, two of his kids, another guy, and me). 

Well, about a year into the job my mom was going through a particularly rough round of treatment. There was one week in January in which my dad was unable to get out of traveling for work (his boss made it clear that it was non-negotiable). And there was really no one else available who could provide the level of care for my mom that she needed. Not many family members can put their lives on hold for a week. So, I did what I had to; I went and stayed with her for that week. It was short notice to ask for time off, but I told my boss the situation and figured he'd understand. After all, he's a good Christian family man. 

Well, when I got back to work, my bass made the job a living hell. And he ended up only scheduling me for 10 hours a week for the new semester. One shift was only an hour. Then he even had the audacity to talk with me about how my actions affect other people, and how my family emergency got in the way of some of his family's recreational plans. I mean, where I'm from it's not uncommon for a small business to just close for a couple of days in situations like this. And it's not like the store really did more than a couple hundred bucks on a typical day. And probably less on an off month when students are gone. But instead he chose to have one of his kids miss out on the fun, and just hate me for it. 

I put in my two weeks the next week and haven't regretted a moment of it. And, most importantly, my mom is doing great. Years of clear checkups now. So, keep your head up and don't spend too much time worrying about people who handle your situation poorly. "

It may not seem like it's possible, but it is.  Just like burritos with french fries inside -- had a little time wrapping my head around that one, but I kinda get it.

0,8837,"First of all, stay strong! It sounds like your mother is just ignoring the truth to try to keep her reality intact when she should really be supporting you. 

Please do seek counseling not because it's your problem but because it might help you cope with your anxiety and let you vent in a supportive environment. 

As for what you should do, don't move back in and don't contact your parents until they acknowledge what happened what needs to be done.

I know it's going to be really hard but you need to put your foot down and it works. I had to take that step with my parents for them to acknowledge their abuse. 

As an educated young woman, you've got the smarts and the will power to turn this around. ",8838,"I'm a single mother of a teen girl. If I caught wind that ANY family member hurt her the police would be called, medical and mental health professionals called and in your case, a divorce attorney and no contact order within 24 hours.

Move far away, get help, and one day when you're a Mom you will fully understand how truly fucked up she is. ",8839,"I agree with this as a new mom.

I would also think about telling her how upset you feel about her lack of concern for all this. I would have another conversation with her about that. Sorry that happened to you OP, stay strong. ",8841,"Your mother isn't innocent in this.  She knows what's been happening and she's still left you alone with him.  She's made no effort to protect you, or even validate you.

By all means, go to therapy.  Not because your mom suggested it, not because she thinks it'll help you push everything down, but because it'll help you to cope with everything.  Coping =/= suppression.  It might get ugly for a bit.  But you'll figure out what you need to heal properly.",8842,"Don't go. Literally ANY other option is a better option.

You sound really smart and you need to break the issues down and start sorting them out in order of importance. 

Firstly you need to find a place to live. How old are you? Are you too young to work? If not, you can find a part time shitty job and get the smallest room in the worst area and I promise it will feel nicer and safer than the family home. Is there any support at all in your country that can help with this? 

Secondly get yourself some counselling when you can and only if you want to. It's all about looking after yourself now. 

Thirdly I think you should cut your parents off. Do not feel guilty they paid for your education this is what they are meant to fucking do. Not molest you and ignore it. Fuck them - you owe them NOTHING. 
",8848,"Dear Mom,

My father sexually abused me. I am not willing to put myself in that position ever again. I will not be returning home while he lives there. 

Thank you for understanding that I could never live with my abuser. When I get my own apartment you are welcome to visit anytime.

Love, 

______________

I left home at 17 because of emotional abuse that culminated into physical assault. It's tough, but not that hard. Getting a room in shared housing is pretty cheap, about $500 where I live. And since you're done college it should be easier to get a job than it was for a 17year old. 

I got a job that covered counseling and I went! It took a while for me to face the fact that my mom knew what was happening and excused it. It took 6 years for it to sink in for her and now she's getting counseling but still lives with him. "
0,8932,"I mean, you recognise the difference and try so much to lessen the gap. Idk, in my books you're awesome.",8933,This is how I think I’d feel if I became rich. Like I was living someone else’s life. But it sounds like it couldn’t have happened to a nicer person and I’m glad those people work for you. ,8934,"> I feel so much guilt when someone cleans my toilet, picks up my dog’s poop, or does my dishes.

Why? I mean, they're getting compensated to do these things. It's not indentured servitude. They have the choice to quit whenever they want to. 

I mean, I kinda get how you would feel guilty having the money and time now to do whatever you want to do and seeing other people not having the same opportunities. 

The thing is, the world ain't fair. It's far from it. You have people born into wealth who most likely never have to work a day in their lives if they didn't want to. You also have a huge number of people born into absolute poverty or in an environment where mortality rates are relatively high.

However, it's not like this is how things are because of something you yourself did. It's just the way the world is through no fault of your own.

Also, just because someone works these types of jobs doesn't mean they're unhappy or live a life of constant misery. Sure, they most likely don't have a ton of spare cash. However, a lot of people still live relatively happy lives with limited wealth. 

Your housekeepers may be grateful for being employed by someone as considerate and generous as yourself. As your husband said, these people are looking for jobs to put food on the table. It's much better to have an awesome boss than a horrible one.

> I noticed that when I had offered her snacks, she put some in her purse when she thought I wasn’t looking.

Yeah, you're going have to talk to her. You should make it clear that she's welcome to help herself to whatever she likes (within reason), but stealing of any forbidden items will not be tolerated.",8935,"Would you think the same way if you suddenly ended up back to the beginning? Or if you hadn't married a rich man?  You don't owe anyone anything, to be fair, but your husband is the one making the money, that means he's rich and your just hanging on that. Enjoy the opportunity you got, because very few people get to live the lifestyle you do without putting in the work (and even if they did don't get rich). Your kids won't grow up knowing what's it's like to be poor, and you get to live being served on hand and foot. Stay humble, and hope there's always a truffle for the pig to find.",8936,You said exactly what I wanted to say without me having to say it.,8937,"Wait, why are you worried about becoming S & K? They were good people and good to you?",8938,"I understand how you feel. From the sound of it, I believe that S&K were feeling somewhat guilty about their privileges too. As a result, they tried to be nice....but honestly making a comment like “honey, truffles are really expensive” doesn’t sound so kind to me, it’s rather...mean. All I could say is, please try to live your life to the fullest and never take things for granted. We all need to be reminded of it from time to time. ",8939,"I imagine I would feel similarly in your position. I've also worked for very wealthy people as a nanny. 

I like to think I would be happy to help others out the way I was helped out. But I don't think it would be easy to let others do all the work when I'm so used to doing it. Idk.",8940,">I feel awful for being the type of person to employ people to do stuff I feel like I could do on my own. 

Don't feel awful. Based on what you said, you sound like a great employer! Just be careful not to change.",8941,"I get you. Enjoy the transformation, life is a beautiful journey! By being you and doing the things you want, you can learn new things, inspire others, and share things people would normally never come across (like a job!). 

As long as you are self aware and don't let it give you a default sense of supremacy, you're good. I wouldn't call it hard but it definitely has it's hardships and can be kind of lonely. Doors have been opened to you that isn't opened to many, for everyone's sake don't waste it!
",8942,I can see where the guilt is coming from. But you also seem like a humble person and a good employer. As long as you don’t exploit the class you have or the privilege that comes with it (which you really don’t) there’s no need to feel so bad. Cheers. ,8943,"The title sounded to me like this “”

We've been married 32 years!,8969,This makes me smile!,8970,So sweet. What do you think makes a marriage strong? How do you handle the downs? I’ve been going through some stuff and would love to know. ,8971,"I think it’s probably a combination of a lot of different things. I don’t know what kinds of challenges you guys are facing, and I can’t say for sure that the things that work for us will also work for you, but I don’t mind sharing about a few things that I think have helped to keep us strong in our marriage. Flirting is important. Even when you’re irritated or tired or stressed or whatever. And as corny as it sounds, it’s important to consciously and actively look for and recognize as many positive things about your spouse as you can find; good or bad, you WILL find whatever it is that you’re looking for. And it’s important to remember that looking for the positives always needs to be a constant effort. Obviously, you already know that life isn’t always going to be easy for you guys, and it’s important to remember that you and your spouse aren’t always going to cope with life’s challenges in the same way. I think sometimes it’s necessary to just accept that your spouse is doing what works for them, and that they don’t necessarily have to change the way that they’re coping or deal with things the way that “we” think that they should deal with them. Also, human beings are inherently imperfect and fallible. So there is an absolute 100% guarantee that your spouse will fail you or let you down (to some degree) at some point during your relationship. It’s going to be up to you to decide how upset you should be and whether or not it’s something that you can forgive. It can be really hard to remain objective when you’re disappointed, angry, frustrated, or heartbroken...but make an unbreakable promise to yourself that you will always consider the bigger picture as well as multiple perspectives. If you can do that objectively, the circumstances are likely to appear more or less awful than they originally did... but at least you will have a better idea of whether or not you’re being unfair to your spouse, if you’re handling things appropriately, or if you’re compromising your own happiness, safety, or integrity. Try not to be unfair, always make a point to learn from your mistakes, and always forgive yourself for your imperfections...but never ever ever compromise your long-term happiness, your safety, or your integrity. Take good care of yourself, OP. I really hope you will find easier days just around the corner. ",8972,">Also, human beings are inherently imperfect and fallible. So there is an absolute 100&#37; guarantee that your spouse will fail you or let you down (to some degree) at some point during your relationship.

But, when I finally agreed to get married, I knew I was determined to have one!

I was married to a guy just like your husband; we were young, he was so unmotivated and two- faced. I couldn't believe a single thing he said. He became physically violent when our daughter was 2, and that was it for us. (Not trying to say that your spouse will become violent as well, I don't know about his temperament).

Leaving was the hardest thing I've ever done. I lost everything I had (it was not a lot, but I'd worked hard to have a nice little home for my daughter and I despite what her dad was like). But it really does get so much better that it's unbelieveable. I've had some seriously scary, hard times since we got out of there, but I've never regretted leaving because my quality of life was once again under my own control. 

My daughter changed, too. I hadn't thought she was old enough to pick up on the unrest in our marriage, but she flourished afterward. It was beautiful.",9167,I don't have any good advice to share but just wanted to send you love and a big virtual hug. I'm so sorry you're going through this... ,9168,"Talk to him about staying home and focusing on school/taking child to school, while YOU get the break and start working. I’d save money on the side and if you still feel trapped.. use that saved money to start taking child to daycare and leave husband if that how you still feel! 
There is NOTHING worse than feeling that frustration and anger towards your partner. You deserve better IMO. ",9169,"Hi OP,

Can you try filing for some sort of public assistance? If (when) your husband gets fired, you’ll likely be eligible for it. 

Worst-case scenario, tough it out until September. You can look for apartments that have a bus stop for your son to get to and from school. There are jobs that allow you to have evenings free with your child—they may not be the job you *want* (serving, food industry, etc), but they’re out there and 1000x better than your current situation. Local churches likely offer discounted daycare prices, so if you get on PA, you may be able to get a job now AND pay to keep your son in daycare. OR, if your husband gets fired, HE can watch your son while you work and stash away your getaway fund.

In the present, stop getting disappointed in your husband. Stop having expectations for him—you’ll just be let down. Men like him don’t change. But there is a light at the end of this tunnel! 

I’m so sorry you’re in this predicament. ",9170,"You don’t state how old you are, but I assume you’re over 18? This may be an unpopular opinion, but why are your parents responsible for providing free child care and transportation? It would be a nice thing for them to do, but they don’t owe it to you. Plenty of people have parents who don’t help out, and they make it work. 
If you gave up on finding work without looking into welfare, subsidized daycare, etc. then you are as responsible for your situation as they are. 
The only person who can get you out of this rut is you, and you need to stop seeing your situation as something that “happened to” but rather something you had a hand in creating. ",9171,I feel for the parents. She is calling them abusive but... They live with her parents. They seem to be already sacrificing their golden years. ,9172,"And their crime would be to try to adopt her child and kick her out of the house. What monsters, taking care of a small child in their retirement and kicking out their adult child.",9173,"First of all wanna say that I'm really sorry this is happening. I don't have any experience with this kind of situation but know that you are justified in being upset and angry. As far as your parents go.. So they refuse to pick him up from anything but wouldn't hesitate to adopt him if you left your husband? That's pretty ridiculous and selfish on their part. You need to have a discussion with them and tell them that if they're not going to help for your sake, they should at least help for your child's sake. This isn't your fault, and it *is* possible to make this better. It's not going to happen overnight but it doesn't mean that you can't push past this.",9174,"It never ceases to amaze me the sort of people that others will saddle themselves with indefinitely.  Somebody's gotta be the grown up here and it's gonna have to be you.  Go get yourself an entry-level job once the kid starts going to school, and start saving money for your eventual departure.  This dude isn't going to change on any sort of reasonable timeline, and why should he?  From his view he has it made: rent-free with a live-in caretaker.  You're going to have to take ownership of your own life if you ever want to get out from under the crushing weight of this dude's mediocrity."

Thankfully most reasonable people don’t judge groups based on 14 year olds :P We’ve moved for the reasons I already stated, but absolutely have not given up. We learned so much and it was such an important experience to live in a predominantly black community for the first time. And I certainly hope those we met have not given up on white people because of our blundering mess! (: That community doesn’t need us to move out of poverty—it’s people are plenty gifted, resourceful, determined...but I do regret that so much of our time and effort has had to be spent fighting a broken legal system rather than leveraging our privilege to get the state to allocate appropriate resources to the area. And i feel bad that we left—it’s tiring to work and work on bettering your community when you feel ignored. We were so excited to partner with our friends and community, and I wish we could support them in the that way but it’s hard from the opposite coast. But when systems and governments ignore and give up on communities for generations, it’s no surprise when they lash out. I’d be angry, too. I just hope our time there wasn’t wasted, you know?"

0,9275,"Please disassociate yourself with that body (I hesitate to say church) as soon as possible. It sounds very damaging.

It's been a big part of your life since you were born. It's normal to still have fondness for abusive partners or parents and yes, even churches. I've never left a church or a cult but I was raised in an abusive relationship and recently left one of my own. We made very important, lasting connections in our brains when we were young and growing up in these environments. We'll always have a deeper, more nuanced understanding of how abuse thrives.

0,9352,"There are a lot of issues in the porn industry. I won't go into detail or rant here, but just give my suggestions.

Porn that I really recommend people view are from couples that are shared online. You can typically find porn website, tumblr, or reddit (etc) accounts from couples who film and share their own sexual experiences. 

Amateur/home video porn is better in a few ways. There is typically more synergy between the individuals, it's more realistic, and it usually feels less explotative. These are people who care for each other and decide to share their sexual explorations so others can enjoy them. It's not really for money; it's because they enjoy sharing. Production values are way lower. Lighting is poorer. But it's real. 

Whenever this topic comes up, I strongly encourage people to stop viewing ""hollywood"" porn. After personally avoiding professional porn for years, I can't even think about it without cringing. It's just so... fake. Completely unenjoyable to me.

I know Pornhub has verified users that film and produce their own videos, so that's worth looking into. ",9353,"The PornHub Community videos are definitely better, and I also think content made by sex workers themselves (camming, YouTube, etc) is much better, and I like supporting those content creators as well. What really prompted this was me looking for a quick fix for an afternoon romp and digging through so much awful content. If you want good porn you’ve really got to do a bit more work to find it. And at the end of the day what disturbs me as that what most people are watching is, in my opinion, incredibly unhealthy.",9354,"Hear hear, I like xtube too. Agree with everything you said ",9355,"I think the fakeness is the real problem here, not the actual content. For example, the topic OP mentioned is just a taboo many people seem to enjoy watching, there's nothing wrong with it.",9356,"It happened due to the pervasiveness of misogyny in our society, most porn directors are men, and those men are scum bags.

Fyi I'm not an anti porn crusader, that just is what it is.

I forgot his pseudonym but there's a porn director who's been quoted as saying that no one says no on his sets. He refuses to work with professional actresses because they have agents and contracts and won't hesitate to say no when they need/want to because they know what they're doing. He's not a niche bdsm genre director (not that that would make it acceptable either), this is actually able to be considered ""mainstream""...

Another reference i can't remember, a sexologist/sociologist conducted a survey of men at a university and found that a large majority of them wanted to perform facials on their partners. What's interesting is that when asked why most could not provide an answer. Welp something like 90% of all mainstream pornos end with a facial, people masturbate to it, they climax, they have conditioned themselves to it now.

I'm not saying there's anything wrong with that. And im sure there are many women who are into it anyway. It just doesn't seem like something most people would want out of the gate on their own. So it appears that porn directors just doing weird shit for the sake of itself because they get off on the fact that they can, resulting in industry conventions that are pretty far divorced from the realities of people's intimate lives, has sort of hijacked consumers' sexualities and taken them somewhere they wouldnt necessarily be otherwise. 

If only a little bit...

Of couse misogyny sort of permeates our entire culture and it's consequences are seen everywhere. So porn isn't inherently misogynistic and it doesnt have to be, but it is anyway because we are.

But in so far as it is, and does have an influence on the rest of our culture, it might be somewhat of a resonance chamber for misogyny.

In any case it's not likely stopping any time soon. We all would have to wake up enough to refuse to consume the majority of the weird/violent shit in the mainstream genre(s?) before the industry would start to change.
But that's not terribly likely.
And in the mean time, the vast majority of consumers are non paying (pornhub) now. Which means just the act of paying for porn has become limited to a pretty small group of enthusiasts who's taste may not be in line with most people's anyway.

I find it really annoying because I personally don't like facials and it's goddamn impossible to find anything that doesnt end with one. And yeah a lot of stuff in the vanilla porn is fucking... not vanilla at all. I mean when I see a pretty girl's face... I want to kiss her face, not cum on it. Why would that even be a thing? And I'm not going to want to kiss her face when it's covered in cum, so that kinda ruins it. Of course thats exactly the point. It's just gross. For the sake of gross.

Not that I'm repulsed by cum, that's just, kinda, part of sex. And sure, it can be hot. Bet even when it's not a facial 90% of the rest of the time actresses doing unmentionable weird gross shit involving various other orifices is what you get. No matter what, it always gets taken way too far to some weirdo bizarro gross out challenge shit and im like...

I don't want these.

You're right it's just impossible to find porn of just... normal human sex. Wtf???",9358,"The stories about people who no longer have fulfilling sex lives because of porn addiction absolutely breaks my heart. I had an ex who struggled with it, along with the death grip problem. It sucked for me but was so much worse for him I think.",9359,I would be very careful equating it with drugs and exaggerating the problem by using this subreddit as a source. It's the same with video games.,9361,"You’re absolutely right. Porn is highly addictive and it can re wire your brain to think and behave differently. It can be detrimental to your mental health, behavioral health, sexual health, romantic relationships, and family relationships. Most people don’t realize how damaging it can be and when you tell them, they don’t seem to listen, but numerous studies have shown just how negative of an impact it can be. ",9362,"It’s because porn is highly addictive and just like with anything else that’s addictive, you eventually need more and more stimuli. That’s why there’s been such a huge spike in genres like cuckold, incest, rape fantasy, things like that. It’s honestly pretty disgusting. I personally can’t stand porn because I know the kind of damage it can cause for individuals and relationships. I know a lot of people won’t agree with me though and I don’t care to argue about it. ",9363,"I love porn and I am a cam girl so porn and everything is fairly important to me. But...I totally agree. It's a love/hate relationship with porn for sure. It's fun, but also really scary sometimes and I am often so disgusted with the things I see. I fully agree that getting forcefully pounded in the ass by a huge dick sounds so painful and I have no idea how those women handle it. It really would only be a small number of women that actually would like it. It really bothers me too. 

But here are some positive things. I am really happy that independent porn content creators like women such as myself are taking the lead in the porn industry. We are making the rules and calling the shots.  The interest in cam girls and individual women making custom videos is HUGE and it really makes me feel hopeful. I am noticing as I am getting more and more fans, they say they dislike mainstream porn and they prefer to watch solo cam girls because they want to see a woman actually be in pleasure and to be able to do what she wants. Also, women are directing porn more, and there are women-lead porn companies arising. This definitely doesn't solve everything but thank God there is some improvement. 

",9364,"I am a guy and gave up porn. The best thing I ever did. I could see myself spiralling down this filthy rabbit hole. Nothing good can come from porn and that is my honest opinion. This in turn helped me stop masturbation and turned my life around.

She hated and resented my mother for the position she found herself in, and pushed her out of the family completely because of it. My mom hid this from me in order to have a good relationship with her, but as I got older I started to notice the unspoken tension. It was all brought to the table about a year ago and they don't speak now. This feeling you have will go on for generations, as it has for my family, and eventually, even if it's 70 years from now, you will be forced to confront it in some way. The guilt will be unbearable if you don't do the right thing now. My grandmother cries with every phone call, and I beg my mom every day to forgive her mother, to try to understand the very feelings you're having now. 


It's easy to feel stuck. So many are. But you don't have to stay with him. And if you do stay with him, you don't have to stay in the house all the time. You can get a job again! Your child may be a handful but you have a duty to them to do the best you can. I'm sorry you have that kind of pressure, but there are solutions you can find to figure this out and thrive. 


Take his bank statements and calculate your families actual cash flow. Come up with your own budget that accommodates for some kind of childcare, even if it's only for 3 hours on a Tuesday with a groupon. If he refuses to get on board with that, take his card and prepay or get a bit of cash out while he's sleeping. If you guys are so broke you truly can't afford to do that, then don't worry. Odds are you have some skill or service you can provide in exchange for childcare on craigslist- maybe you can help a 16 year old with her resume or something in exchange. So d what you've got to do to get it, and then take that time and relax. 


Start looking into some kind of part time position or odd job you can do from home for now. Call center, typist, whatever. Do it while he's gone. Save up without his knowledge while you work at home and slowly purchase the things you need- a ""thrifted"" pair of shoes that he doesn't know the real cost of, etc. Put together a decent interview/work wardrobe over the next year or so while you save up your acorns.


Whether you've left him and are living in a studio with help from your parents, or you're still married, fast forward to a year from now. 


You've been quietly working and saving up, paying for some alone time when you can, and doing your best. Your kid is 2 now, which means everyday care will be easier to find. Lots of programs are available that have free or partially paid daycare, so take advantage of them and use your small secret savings while you establish your career again. Try to find a company with daycare perks- they are out there. 


Before you know it you'll be back in your comfortable environment, doing what you love, and providing for your child as well. It might take a while but there is light at the end of the tunnel, and you don't have to resent your position in life. You can change it. Before you know it this will be a distant memory. The first thing you should do is just take a walk and picture it. Then do it. I'm rooting for you!






",9378,"Thank you for you story, advice, and kind words. ",9379,Sounds like you need some help. Resenting your child is never a good thing. Obviously your husband is not in it 50/50 with you and that needs to change or you need to leave. Sounds like you’re having a rough time.

Listen, real talk, I'm not going to say anything you don't know or that other's haven't said, but I'm going to say it anyway. You need help with your baby. You DESERVE help with her. You seem depressed and overwhelmed and that's a completely reasonable response to the situation as you've laid it out.

There are a few options, of course, but the most direct and I think the first one is to sit your husband down and say ""this will change or I will leave"" and then be prepared to do so even if it means leaving the country you call home and going to somewhere you'll have a support system. 

You owe it to yourself and your little girl to be happy. An unhappy, resentful, angry mother isn't who you want to be and it's not who you should be forced to be because your husband doesn't contribute. ""Working a lot"" is a bullshit excuse and it's doing a disservice to his family. What will it leave him in the end? Not a little girl who adores him or a wife who feels like his partner in life. 

You are strong enough to find your way to happiness. It'll take time, but you've already made the first step. You CAN do this.

I know it's not the same...
But my in-laws have always done Sunday birthday lunches for everybody. My hubs and his sister, her husband, all eight grandkids, even granddaughters hubs. 
Everyone but me. 
Hubs refuses to admit that is the way it is. See, MIL's birthday is 5 days before and FIL's is the day before mine. So they have a birthday lunch together to celebrate theirs. SIL cooks(she lives next door to them).  And I'm always left out. After one year mentioning it was my birthday the next day, my nieces thought I was joking and didn't believe me. It got to the point that I just don't go if my birthday falls on or close to that Sunday because I deserve to have a damn day to celebrate. Who wants to spend their birthday singing to other people and never being acknowledged?!?!

Hubs thinks I'm wrong, I'm included too. 
So last bday lunch when singing happy birthday to them I went. Singing the HB song he added my name. Everyone else just looked at him and my SIL saids ""oh yeah, guess it is your birthday""

Makes you feel special to know 14 other people get a birthday lunch. But you get ""oh yeah, guess it is your birthday""

My answer is based on the fact that my mom chose her husband over me. I didn't get pregnant (I was too young), and he did keep on violating and hurting me after she proved she wouldn't take me permanently to safety.

So, here's my advice: tell your mom, but if she doesn't do what she should do (get you immediately to the police and to safety), YOU need to go to the police ASAP, one way or another. Call CPS if you have to. If you have another trusted adult in your life, going to them next should be an option, but going directly to the authorities is okay, too.

You can and should tell your mom.   But if she won't listen or won't help, there are people who will.  Talk to a friend's mom.  If you have to, reach out to the nearest women's shelter (they do more than just house abused women), or rape crisis center.  

It IS NOT your fault, not in any way.

You can make it through this, I promise.  I'm in my 40s now and while I still have a few bad days here and there, life is pretty good.  Please, no matter what happens or how your mom reacts, don't hurt yourself because someone did something terrible to you.  Life can get better, it really can.

I know someone who had a friend in middle school. His friend got beaten up one day by one of his classmates. His teacher asked him what happen and he didn't say anything because he didn't want his attacker to get in troubler. So he didn't say anything and his classmate got away with it. A few years later, he told me that the attacker was put in jail for beating someone up to death. He regretted not telling his teacher that his classmate beat him up. He kept on say, ""I could have saved a life...""

",9740,"Anyone who would call you a bad person probably doesn’t have a child of their own, or understand the depth of a parent’s need to protect their baby. 

I wish you the best, and have fun with the little one. They grow up so damn fast. ",9741,In the sub we are all free of the dog infestation. I would question your choices of you kept your mutt. I'm sure it was hard.,9742,"You are a good parent and person for protecting your child, and a good pet owner for realizing that your home is no longer an appropriate one for your pet. Don't doubt yourself. This is the first of many tough decisions you're going to have to make as a parent. Believe in yourself. You've got this. 

If you ever need to talk, feel free to inbox me. I have raised two kids to ages 14 and 10, and I know how hard it can be, but my kids are turning out to be amazing people.  I am happy to offer you an ear, a shoulder, or advice if you want it. And my first piece of advice is this: Tell your doctor and your partner about your ""baby blues.""  PPD is real and scary, but you don't have to white-knuckle your way through it alone. There's help for that. Second piece of advice: Join a new parent group as soon as possible. I swear to god that's all that kept me sane early on. It's been 14 years and I've moved to a new city, but I still talk to the women I met at my new moms' group almost every day. 

Good luck to you, friend. I really mean it: Don't hesitate to message me if you need to talk. ",9743,"Very hard for you, but you would never forgive yourself if she hurt someone else or your child. 
I know it seems hard, but congratulations on your baby and the first of many sacrifices you will have to make for her. ",9744,thank you :(,9745,"I know it’s hard to let go of a close friend/pet, but this is one of those moments that reminds us, as attached as we feel, it is just a pet and comes nowhere close to as important as a baby (or your mother for that matter). 

While rescue is a wonderful thing, when a baby is involved it becomes very important to know the background of your pet and ensure there isn’t even the slightest bit of risk it might not be baby friendly. 

Nevertheless, we feel for you 🤗",9746,"I rescued her 3 years ago, unfortunately, before I met my babies father or knew i could even have a baby. ( i have PCOS ). it was a totally unplanned but amazing surprise and we never imagined this would happen because she is great with toddlers and kids, just not babies :(",9747,Sometimes life can be so unpredictable :(,9748,"I’m so sorry about your dog, it must be a horrendous predicament to be in.
Sometimes rescues just don’t work out but at least you are being sensible and realise this as much as we treasure our pets and love them we can’t endanger our children.

On an ER visit a couple of years ago with my daughter we knew we would be in for a while so I brought an iPad with movies downloaded to help calm her and take her mind off of why we were there and as it was a surgical complaint in this particular hospital children attend the same ER as adults rather than the children’s ER there is one room with two beds that is used for children needing surgery and there was one other child there  I asked her would she like to watch a movie on the iPad with my daughter I’m almost sure it was Frozen or something similar which had just been made available to download from the iTunes Store, as it turned out she was only 2 and a half and had almost her entire face bandaged and as I chatted to her mom she explained what had happened to her their family dog of 8 years a rough collie like lassie attacked the child so severely in a completely unprovoked attack that most of one side of the child’s face had been removed if you will, and part of the other side of her face, the mother was very upset and said her face was unrecognisable and I assured her that it probably only seemed worse due to the blood and the shock from the attack which seemed to comfort her.

When the doctor came around the child was not budging from watching the iPad with my daughter and the only way she would allow him to look at it was if he crouched down beside her while she watched the movie the mother asked if I minded I said not at all, the doctor carefully inspected it without my daughter being able to see but when the bandages were removed I honestly thought I would never sleep again it was the stuff of nightmares.I wasn’t expecting it to be as bad as it was.

In my opinion I think you are right to rehome the dog but please inform it’s new owners that it needs a child free home."

Also there's probably too much pressure with keeping this a secret (maybe why you have anxiety) and sharing it with another person face to face will releave some pressure. I hope everything works out for you. Much love. ",9779,"I second this. Please seek therapy. Not immediately if you aren't ready, but eventually. My ex wife never sought therapy and used substances to self medicate. It finally destroyed our marriage. Eventually your situation in life evolves and you need to adapt to it. You need to approach this the right way when the time is right. Otherwise you could end up like us. ",9780,"I’ve been wondering seeking a therapist, or just even telling one friend... but every time I try to physically speak the words, I get sick. I ask myself, “why burden my friends with such a dark story? why put this on any of my friends...?” I love them too much to have them know such dark things about me. ",9781,"That's why I think a therapist would be best. They're an objective person, who've been trained to deal with stories like yours. You don't have a personal connection like with friends and family. Also you don't have to talk about anything too deep until your comfortable. Most therapist actually prefer to ease people in. Therapy is very beneficial to anyone/everyone. I recommend looking at different t types of therapy treatments and find what seems best for you. ",9782,"I work for a sexual and domestic abuse organization (in Texas actually), and unfortunately, your story, and the way it progressed, is extremely common. If you are holding onto any blame for yourself, about how naive you were, why you didn't do anything to stop it, etc., just know you are not alone. I agree with some of the other responses about counseling, there are some amazing counselors out there who specialize in sexual abuse. Though using Molly makes you feel better, I'm not sure how sustainable that is long term, especially if you enter a situation where you are drug tested (not sure if that would affect you, but it's something to keep in mind.) As long as you are holding onto this, chances are it's going to be a burden, and you definitely don't deserve that.

But in the long run it will make things even worse ",9787,Damn life can fucking suck sometimes & I'm sorry that this happened to you. I hope one day you'll be able to open up to people you know & find the peace you need. I'm glad molly has helped you through this as a coping mechanism but I can't help but suggest you find new coping mechanisms. You deserve to feel good & free without a stimulant. Im sending you my love💜 ,9788,"You are incredibly strong. It takes a lot out of you to go through what you did and on too of that share your story. I'm glad you're starting to feel better through Molly but that isn't a permanent solution. Like other comments have said, you should maybe try counseling or even just sharing your story with someone face to face. And please please please if you're ever considering hurting yourself reach out to anyone and let them know. I would be more than happy to talk to you if you don't want to talk to a family member or friend. I have an older brother who recently just told me that he's considered suicide multiple times and the thought of him being alone and thinking that or losing him just tears me apart. It sounds like you have a lot of people in your life who care about you, and now you have one more internet stranger to add to that list. I wish the best for you and your recovery."

0,9954,"Take a nearly nude photo. Give it a solid month of diet and exercise. Stay comforted just for that month. Tell yourself all you gotta do is the month.

I was too uncomfortable to do this before I got serious about diet and excercise, and now I wish I had it for motivation!

On a related note, give it a few weeks before you compare yourself using photos or a scale, if you do it daily you won't notice the change, but when you wait a month and see the difference it is really motivational.",9956,"My biggest tip to you is to spend the next few weeks seriously calorie counting everything you eat, even if you don't change your diet at all, just to educate yourself. You will be surprised what foods that you like equally are vastly different in terms of calories. And pay close attention to things like cooking oil. If you go to make a ""healthy"" side of sautéed broccoli, but splash 2tbs of olive oil in the pan - that is as many calories as a McDonald's cheeseburger.

0,9971,"I will disagree if only because on principle, I do believe people do fall in love (real love).  

However, I cannot disagree in whole as I do agree that a lot of people toss the word love around so carelessly and effortlessly, that many overuse and abuse its importance.  I believe there are many people who are in love with the idea of love and haven't truly loved or been loved.

But digress because I do believe the love between couples can indeed exist and can be genuine true love.",9972,"Thank you for your thoughts. 

I really do want to believe too. Perhaps it’s more accurate for me to say that I have yet to see it. ",9973,"yeah, ""love"" is thrown around too much. i think your OG post is right for about 75% of relationships, but i do think that certain couples do exist who really do love one another. its just rare these days",9974,"I would say that's more accurate man, just because that's your experience from all these examples doesn't mean there aren't couples genuinely in love out there. A lot of people in the world, and have been in the world.",9975,"You can’t be told or explained how to fall in love. You just do. Unless you feel love, nobody is gonna be able to convince you about it, it is something you will have to find on your own.",9976,"In my experience with this so far (and I'm only 26 mind you, lots of inexperience here), the concept of love as an individual concept without connection to those other concepts: lust, convenience, ego, or fear, is pretty much impossible. Love cannot exist without a trigger of one of those kinds (fear of being alone, ego inspiring flattery, forming convenient romantic bonds, or lusting after someone enough to better oneself and either earning theirs or another's love). 

I've thought a lot about what love means to me and I can't really conceive of love existing in a vacuum on its own. There needs to be something else there, and usually it's fear of being alone. Which makes sense, we're a social species that needs a pair of genetic material to continue our DNA's existence, there needs to be a reason to bring two of our species together. We just happen to slap a sloppy label on it all, called love.

But idk, there's probably something I've not learned yet about life that will change my view someday. We'll see.",9977,"Just gave this some more thought, and it occurred to me that maybe what we're thinking of as ""pure, unadulterated love"" is actually the love we feel when all the mentioned triggers/groundings are foundations for the relationship, so no one of them stands out and feels contrived or wrong.",9978,"My wife and I have been together for 7 years and there is still no loss of attraction.  She is the 9th long term relationship I have had in life and since the first date everything has been completely different than the previous relationships. We work hard to get through issues, continue to have inventive kinky sex and go on adventures all over the world.  I suppose it is possible things could change, but we have both agreed that if there is a loss of attraction, a tragedy, severe depression or resentment or whatever we will stay until it is resolved.  Also we have gone through all of that many times and we always persevere until we move into a solution of some sort . The type of attraction has changed obviously.  The initial lust and infatuation is chemical and therefore changed obviously, but we continue to find reasons to love each other.
We both have lots of friends, challenging careers and lots of hobbies. We are hyper aware of avoiding codependent behavior and have communicated every fear and desire since the very start.
I don’t think that our relationship could work for everyone.  I also think that some people just never find true love due to luck or a lack there of.  I really do think I just got super lucky and I try to acknowledge it on a regular basis.",9979,"I’ve been around the block once or twice, had my ups and downs. It’s easy to dissect love and theories it, but when it happens (and in my experience you will learn to know it when it ends before it begins).

It’s the most powerful thing and if it’s never experienced and reciprocated that must be the saddest thing.",9980,"100% correct love is an action not a feeling. That feeling is eros- a desire and attraction which is very important in the beginning stages of a relationship but ultimately temporary. Loving someone means showing the aspects of love (patience, kindness, generosity, humility, gentleness and forgiveness) to them even when they are at their most unlovable, it is constant hard work. Reading between the lines you strike me as a believer if so take heart, there is such a thing as love, it just isn't what people think it is now days. 

But what do I know, I have never been in love. 

",9981,I dont believe in love either. Never experienced it and dont think I ever will. ,9982,I think a lot of people mix up love and infatuation.

The problem I’m facing right now, is that doctors have given me a gray spectrum from severely disabled to completely normal, with either being just as likely at this point.

All of this just happened this past week, so they are still running tests to determine brain function and whether or not the Ventriculomegaly is progressive. If it is, then I’ll certainly do the right thing and terminate. It just breaks my heart. ",10023,"First, let me say, I’m so sorry about your sister.  I can’t imagine how hard that must have been for your whole family.

However, the other considerations are the medical advancements that have been made since your sister passed.  Since you mention that you have now grown up and had your own children now, I’m guessing it was quite a few years ago.

My own daughter has a fatal genetic disease. The doctors told us she would be lucky to see 12 and she’s already 13.  But, my daughters condition and this one are not the same.  You have much more experience with this kind of condition.

I absolutely agree with getting a second opinion and to the OP, I’m so incredibly sorry for the decision you have to make.  No parent should ever be put in that situation especially with so many what ifs.  My heart breaks for you, OP.  I know that means very little coming from a random internet stranger but I mean it sincerely.

",10025,"That's a heartbreaking decision to make either way. Do understand when you make your decision based on what you believe to be the best for your daughter, you must not blame or torture yourself with ""what if""s. I'm so sorry things turned out this way. ❤",10026," I am so sorry you have to deal with this. Are you able to go to university of San Francisco? The following is from their website  about enlarged ventricles in tuero ""The best outcome is typically observed when: 1.) the fetus' ventricles are only mildly enlarged (measure between 10-15 millimeters in size, 2.) when there are no other problems seen on the ultrasound, and 3.) the genetic testing results are normal—this is called “Isolated Mild ""  there are a lot of factors affecting outcome. At UCSF they do brain MRI of the fetus to get more information that could be helpful to determine outcome. Could you talk to a pediatric neurologist and pediatric neurosurgeon who see how babies do in real life after they are born to get their perspective? That would mean two different appointments just getting a broader perspective of what you might be dealing with.

Some people just have bigger than average ventricles and have a shunt and are fine. Some have severe enlargement with other brain abnormalities that can't be seen on Ultrasound but can be seen on MRI. Knowledge is power. Go someplace where doctors have more experience in this.  What ever you decide will be the right decision. You are the mother and are in the best position to decide what you think is best once you have more facts. Hugs",10027,"My daughter’s vents are bilaterally enlarged and symmetrical, at 12mm each. However, her third ventricle is swollen at 3mm which they normally do not see. We live in a bit of a rural area of Arizona, so it’s tough getting the opinions and consults that we really need at this point.

Have you been able to find support groups for families in this type of situation? There has to be online forums for families that had to make such a decision. I suggest looking on here and on Facebook. I am a young widowed and my support groups, online and in person have helped tremendously. Also, therapy for you and your husband would be a good idea.. before any decision is made and of course afterwards as well. From what I have witnessed from friends and family in similar situations, the guilt from even thinking it was better, it would be better, to let the child go can be extremely difficult to carry around.. and can be very hard on a marriage.. therapy alone and together is never a bad idea. 

So much love to you!!! ",10029,"You can look into [Perinatal Hospice](https://www.perinatalhospice.org) and see if there is local support in your area.  I would also suggest a merry round with Mr. Google to see what support groups are available to you.  I had a daughter with a rare and fatal birth defect and was able to find support groups specifically for that condition.

I would not rely on just one person's medical advice.  I think /u/KLMQ5 has pretty solid advice on getting a second opinion.  Even if you can't go to *the* place for this condition, there may be a better-equipped, more knowledgeable facility nearby that you can get to for an evaluation.  I'm not saying ""the doctors are wrong"", just that with a condition that apparently has a very wide range of possible outcomes, close evaluation is worthwhile.  Even with a condition like my daughter had, which has had two or three known survivors over three decades, there are disagreements over the standard of care, and through the support group I am in I have come across a distressing number of women who were given just enough info to make the choice their care provider wanted them to make.",10030,"A family member had to make that very same decision for the exact same reasons a few months ago. I think I know how you and your partner feel right now. I just want to tell you that there is a life for you and the other members of your family after this unfair and horrible decision, even if you maybe cannot see beyond that point now. 

All the strength in the world for you!",10031,"I want to start my post by saying whatever decision you make, it is the right decision for you.

I work with children aged 5-21 with a variety of developmental disabilities. I just want to give another perspective since the top rated comment at this time speaks nothing but horror over neurological defects and medical frailty.

The looming decision you have to make is an extremely heart wrenching one. No one can touch upon how hard this decision will be on you, your family, and your friends. If you decide to bring this baby to term and they survive with medical conditions requiring continuous care, they and you, can still live a fulfilling life.

The trials that would be ahead of you will be profound, but in that there is a possibility for growth, learning, and a continuum of small victories that can enrich your family. That being said, it will be extremely hard work but there are resources out there. 

If you know this baby girl is heading down that road, arm yourself to advocate for her and your family once you are emotionally able. It’s okay for this to take time. No one will expect you to know all the answers out of the gate. Support groups exist for guidance and compassion. Reach out to any
Therapeutic professional you come across because an involved parent is our best friend when we meet your baby. In home nursing care exists to help support you and give some respite. As your child ages, most school districts will give you anything you fight for because they either don’t want to deal with strong parents or they will be grateful to help. Your therapeutic professionals will also help with this. Help is out there once you break the surface.

Best of luck with your decision. No matter what, remember that what ever decision you make (termination or to bring the baby to term) — it is the RIGHT decision for you.",10032,"You mention how hard it will be for OP, the family, and the friends but make no mention of how hard it will be for the actual person living with the condition. How hard will it be for the daughter? how hard for *her* to live a life in pain? Can she live a happy, fulfilling life? ",10033,"That’s where I have an unconventional opinion. The kids I have are aware of their conditions but are just as, if not better, adjusted than their typical peers. There are always the ones that have a worse experience and emotional coping skills, but that’s just the human experience. 

And honestly, if you take a more pessimistic view — they don’t know better.",10034,"Some kids with certain conditions can function relatively okay in the world, struggle a bit, but be just fine. Some are happy still. For some, it's no problem because it's just how life is for them.

And some are not just fine. Some cannot adjust. Some have just pain and misery. Some can't function at all without help, in all forms (people and machine). A person can't just be like ""well, we love them, and we will take care of them and they are so worth it to us."" because they aren't the ones in that body.

This is a time in a relationship to be worried- when happy days and events become like pulling teeth. Everything becomes a struggle, from getting dinner to having a drink. A guy in a happy relationship knows that passing a business card to a cute waitress under his wife's nose is a shitty move. 

I think it's time to have a real heart to heart with your husband. When the real truth comes out, it'll be like popping a big, painful zit. It hurts like shit but all the bad stuff comes bursting out. ",10054,"So if it was a legitimate thing, then he didn’t really do anything wrong. You gotta just think objectively about the situation and decide if it was legitimate.",10056,"I think he legitimately believes he didn’t do anything wrong. But I guess I feel embarrassed as his wife who was sitting there with him all night and then him leaving a business card with the tip to the hot young bartender. I just felt like is it sneaky way for him to hopefully get her attention? Will she maybe secretly reach out to him? It was a Saturday night, alcohol was involved. Conducting business could have waited. That one business card has us fighting even now today and it all could have been avoided. ",10057,"It seems like you are over reacting. Unless he has a history of sneaking around or cheating I think you're being unreasonable. You should really examine why this would even matter to you at all, I say this as a fellow woman.",10058,You are probably right. I think I need to get back to reality. Last night was just a bad night and I still feel stuck in those emotions.,10059,Lol no you were not over reacting. Don't listen to that ridiculous advice. ,10060,DON'T LISTEN TO THIS PERSON. Your husband was way out of line. Your feelings are valid. ,10061,Idk why I'm being downvoted. She literally asked what people thought and I really do think unless there is more to this story she is overreacting.  Like if he was really trying something why would he do it right in front of her? And she didn't say he'd been flirting with the bar tender either. I really think people are too quick to say he's trying something. If my own SO did this I would think absolutely nothing of it.

I asked him to leave, got a divorce, and haven’t regretted it for a minute. I realized all the ways he was a jerk, and how much better, and happier, my life was without him! 

It sucks at first, realizing how selfish your partner is. To experience a betrayal like that. To realize the life you thought you had was a lie, but then you see that now you have freedom to change, to build a better life that will make you happier than your old one did.

0,10104,"Thanks a lot. There's still a chance it could be nothing, but given how quickly it grew, the chance is slim according to the doctor. Still, she said ""it could be an abrasion or scrape and she just made it bigger by scratching it"" (you can never know with kids, even though she claims it doesn't hurt or itch at all). 

I hope it's just a scare, but if it's not... Yeah, she will need me by her side. I'm not going through one of my best moments, but I can make it seem like I am just so she's not scared. I know her first biopsy scared her and it was just on her foot, this time around it's on her throat... And if there's worse to come, she needs me. Really needs me, I can put everything aside for her. I'm disabled so I don't work, I can be by her side 24/7 even if it costs me my declining health, as long as she's all right.

My husband is calm right now luckily, because he had her mom go through breast cancer and they didn't catch it early, yet she still managed and it's been 5+ years and she's doing just great. He says he will obviously be here for both of us whatever happens.

You need to arm yourself with information; it is the only way to stay sane.  Cancer is a game of statistics and odds.  Don't be afraid to ask what's the best case/worst case; you might just find that worst case is a noticeable scar.  I think you'd be happy with that!

How's your kid? Hope all is well and this was just a scare. ",10110,"Sorry, I never made another post because we're still at it.

She got a biopsy, which scared her, but it ended up being negative, and doctors think it's a rare strain of fungi.

She's got it all over her body now, though. We've tried a lot of different creams and it's not going away. The doctors said this had to come from a dog or a cat or another animal (we have a dog and eight cats). We treated them all and then tested them, none of them have any fungi.

We told this to her dad, who also has a dog and a cat. He tested them and they didn't have any fungi either. He even showed me the tests (because I don't think he's very reliable, heh).

She was going to swimming classes, so we thought it could be something like being allergic to chlorine or getting fungus there. So we tested her, but she's not allergic to anything.

She's got spots all over her body, but they don't look to be cancer. She also got two other biopsies, and they're all negative.

Even the doctors don't know what the hell to do, some spots have gone away on their own, but not knowing what is causing them is kind of nerve-wracking.

Next up we're probably going to get her blood tested.

At least, she's doing very well emotionally, the spots don't seem to bother her at all, she's doing well at school, and is very happy because she just lost her first two teeth and got a lot of money from the tooth fairy.",10111,I’ve seen you on this sub a few times and just have to say that despite a lot of things you’ve been through you are incredibly strong as a person.

I really hope it's benign too, but there's still so much time to go until we see the other specialist, then they order the biopsy, then wait until she gets it, then wait again until it's done... Ugh.

0,10138,😏 OP's a machine. Such a strong character and heart. I wish you the best in moving past the mess your husband contributed to (and I know you can),10140,"Reading 1,2..eek it sounded like I could've written this! I mean...the patterns are the same. Sounds like your future ex is a narcissist. Be kind to yourself and heal. You most likely are suffering from trauma. I was married to a man who felt victimized by the world and used that as an excuse to take/thieves from people. Nothing is more infuriating when you're forced in a role in marriage you didn't sign up for. I dumped my ex, got my masters, got a promotion, and travel the world. You're a good person, abused for a long time. You don't deserve that. Go and be happy. Hugs to you!",10142,"Not saying this as a judgement-I'm divorced and probably never should have been married to him looking back. I saw red flags and chose to not see them. So I would ask you:

Did your husband suddenly change? Were there no red flags during your dating period? Did he just SAY he wanted what you wanted, the dreams etc? Or did he ACTUALLY show you with actions that he would be a 'great catch' and was on the same page with life goals?  Actions show the truth of someone, words are meaningless. Is it possible you thought you could change him? That he would 'improve' in time? That you could 'fix' him? Never happens. (I learned the hard way, many women-and men-do.)  If your situation was like mine my ex never needed 'fixing' at all, nor did he think he did. People are just different, what he valued and what I valued simply didn't match up. He actually didn't WANT the 'kick in the ass' I tried to give him, nor should I have thought it was 'my responsibility' to give him that kick. I SHOULD have not denied the that we were NOT on the same page. But I did. My bad. 

I have heard it said you are ready to get divorced when you have no more anger toward your spouse. You have a lot of anger toward him--waiting for poetic justice/karma/feeling like you won etc. Anytime someone elicits such a strong response from us, love, anger-- whatever--- they are someone who is taking up a lot of headspace. 

At this point it's not worth the headspace you are giving to him. Really it's not-the divorce is in the works. And to him it has become nothing more than a social media post. The content of these posts is not important. (You may want to block him if you find it upsetting.) Let the anger go and move forward. I had to do this, and things got a lot better for me. I was SO angry at first and felt so wronged. 

But I learned a lot. The relationship I am in now is so much healthier and we are in tune with life goals. 


AND, my ex and I are actually friends now. Which seems crazy to me, but it's true.

Even when it's for necessary and realistic reasons, divorce sucks. 

Wishing you all the best as you move forward.
 




 ",10144,"Sometimes it DOES just help to type things out. Always helpful for me. And your story has a lot of similarities to my own divorce, including the differences in salaries. And 100% I was also the one who loved the 'fixer upper' man. Not only did it allow me not to focus on my own crap going on (a lot!). But it also mirrored how I felt about myself...I didn't think I deserved anyone 'better'. At the end of my marriage my husband was deep into substance abuse...and I was STILL trying to save him.  Which is beyond ridiculous since I am a mental health counselor and am well aware that you can't save/fix ANYONE. And work with my clients on understanding this fact.  But still I tried, as if I was some exception to this rule. Insane really.

We lived in the same toxic sort of environment in our house for a while--it was hell. So I get that!

Your husband does seem to be absolutely ridiculous about the money thing, insisting on buying and not renting. Wow. I hope your lawyer can clear that all up. After a divorce most of us do have to change our standard of living (to lower!)

Anyway, getting therapy myself, taking responsibility for my own stuff etc. has been worth every last dollar of the co-pay I have paid.
It really is helpful if you can find someone you click with.

Thing might get a little worse before they get better as you go through the divorce process. But it WILL get better! In the meantime, take care of and be kind to yourself...",10145,"Been there.

I give props to the dude for pushing aside stereotypes and doing right by your kids. ",10152,"I know right!? The whole ""cooking and cleaning"" isn't contribution enough really pissed me off. Actually YES it is contributing enough. People get paid a ton of money for it and the fact someone does it for free does not make them less than you. ",10153,"That's all well and good if that had been the division of labor they'd agreed upon, but it doesn't sound like that's the case.  And whether OP had been a man or a woman, most people would support them in their objection to a spouse deciding that rather than contribute financially to the wellbeing of the family, they were going to stay home.",10154,Yes I have to agree with you on this one.. this would be treated very differently if OP was male. ,10155,"As much as you're painting him as a narcissist, it rubbed off on me the wrong way how it came off like you were almost *gloating* that it was you who initiated the divorce. You even flaunted pretty boldly your power in the relationship over him by saying that if you had a sudden change of mind, you knew he'd lap it up in a heartbeat. Just my 2 cents. There's 2 sides to every story and this particular one looks as if both perspectives are needed before a valid opinion can be formed.

I do hope your divorce is smooth and you guys work out an arrangement that maximizes your kid's well-being. "

Seeing individuals I love and am close with slowly lose their true identity due to a relationship is quite unsettling. The changes are often so subtle that the couple doesn't even know it is happening. They just think they are making small concessions to please their partner, but unless these concessions are communicated and talked about then the partner does not see them as the personal sacrifices that they are. I think this can be one of most damaging events in a relationship."

It’s like a normal daycare, but once you sign up, you just book in the times whenever you need them. 

That way you can have a bit of a break when you need it, and be able to prepare for interviews if one comes up.

Also, there are a lot more part-time and school-hours jobs out there. 
Maybe your husband would be less combative over that type of job?

I’m presuming the best in your husband, and hoping that keeping you home isn’t his way of controlling you so you can’t leave. It might be worth asking yourself whether it might be the case though.

Finally, I don’t know if it helps at all, but whenever I was at my wits end with my kiddo, I’d try and remind myself of a happy memory with him, and think about what it would be like to not have him around.

I have 4 boys (oldest is 8) and am currently my own financial support as well. It is the ultimate struggle raising kids in this world and especially without financial stability. I try to just appreciate the simple things. Appreciate how beautiful my children are and be thankful for them. But for a long time I was an angry mom. I went into therapy and it turns out I was really just angry and hurt about a lot of things. Now that I’ve dealt with a lot of that I feel like it wasn’t really my lifestyle that made me miserable. It was more that I was just miserable. I don’t know you. Maybe this isn’t your situation. But I wonder if you’re unhappy with your lifestyle or just unhappy with life. I apologize if I’m off base but this post sounds like something I would have said a year ago.,10208,"This is what I don't understand.

If it seems such a struggle, why have children? or why have so many?

If people planned better or chose better more supportive spouses, perhaps they wouldn't have such a huge burden and wouldn't be so stressed out, tired and so on.

I know children are a permanent change in life. It's not like you can go back. But I don't understand why after the first or even the second baby people keep having babies like crazy then become bitter and complain about all the responsibilities and efforts required to raise them. People themselves chose that path and then they moan about it???

She said she couldn't explain it, once she did cut ties from them and one day by chance she saw her mother in a shop. She started crying because of how old my nan looked. She idolised her mother as she was growing up and said that adoration just never went away. 

She spoke to my pop about it in her late 20s I think and she asked him why he did it. She got quite upset telling me about it so she jumped around a lot but from what I understood he told her he was in a catholic orphanage as a child and was sexually abused himself. My mum said he stared pouring out what happened to him but she cut him off because he began treating her like a confessional.

did to her when I had so many responsibilities as a child I shouldn't have had because of the fall out of her abuse. It wouldn't change anything really either imo, I'd still think what he did was disgusting. All it would do is make me angrier.

Yeah that's what I think I did with my nan, I kind of blocked out anything that wasn't just us having a good time because I think I knew it was impossible for her not to have known but I couldn't admit that to myself until I heard it from my mum.

Good luck to his parents and his teachers, two sets of people trying their best to do their jobs well.",10332,"> made my life hell for a long time [...] until high school divided most subjects by competence

It's kind of sad, but I do think it's true sometimes. I would always get frustrated by kids like this when I was younger, because I selfishly thought that they were taking away time for everyone else because of their own problems. However, I must say that this isn't universal. When I was in high school and was able to finally be in advanced classes for every subject, I thought I could avoid students like this after years of torture. I didn't realize until I was a sophomore that some of the smartest kids in the school had ADHD and other slight problems.

As a young adult in my 20s now, I really do have sympathy for these kids—far too few teachers are properly equipped (often through no fault of their own, though the OP's teachers seem to have ill intents) to handle kids with slight learning/attention issues like this. It must be incredibly frustrating to be a smart kid limited by something like ADD or ADHD. I always thought that they held back ""us normal people"", but boy, was I wrong. Sometimes they're the most competent of us all. 

Good on you, OP, for having a huge heart and being there for your son when he needs you the most. People like you probably give him a lot of hope, even if he never tells you that. I'm sure he knows he can do better, and he will eventually be conditioned well enough without medication to live a mostly normal life, I'm sure. Push through these times of change in middle school—it's a terrible time for everyone, though I imagine it's much worse when something like ADHD is constantly at the back of your mind. Best of luck, OP—my heart goes out to you.

I work as a teacher in Florida. I'm not sure where you live, but does your son have an IEP (individual education plan-It may have a different title in your state)? If not, demand one.  They involve doctors notes, a few meetings, and your consent, but they help a lot. This would allow him to have extra time know tests, quizzes, work of any kind really (including state tests). This allows student to take class work home to complete and turn in at a later date at no penalty. If he does and it isn't being adhered to, the school is at fault. That would be a violation at both district and state level that should immediately be reported. This plan can also allow for special seating arrangements (up front near teacher away from others etc) as well as things like movement. I had an adHD student who was allowed to take notes, do work, and participate while pacing my room or having this box thing he played with( it was a fidget box or something like that...he could basically play with it one handed while doing his work) or he could take 5 and walk the hall(our building has halls that loops back on each other). These teachers should also be using techniques like redirection, buddies, checlists, extended time, and alternative assignments in order to accommodate your son. 
      As an educator, I can tell you that it is extremely difficult to balance these things (especially in large classes) and it does get overwhelming. Often times, they are turning to you because they are out of ideas and districts do not provide training on these matters. Also, there are more parents who dont give a shit than do. So, often they feel abandoned and unable to assist due to lack of information.Tell them what works at home,have your son tell you what he thinks works,and share that as well. Comeven up with a plan and check in frequently. I promise you, if they are worth the title they carry, the teachers want him to do well. If they won't do this, the school and the teachers are a piece of shit. It is our ethic and professional responsibility to ensure every student reaches their potential.",10339,"Omg, can you come be my son's teacher?! I really appreciate all your info. He is on a 504 plan, and he was at one point on an IEP, but he wasn't placed in this until 3rd grade. We had no idea it existed, and it was suggested by one of his more helpful teachers. He has one teacher this year who, from what I've seen, heard, and gotten texts from, is one of those shitty teachers. She frequently sends me messages saying she is constantly having to redirect him, and he's not staying on task. Well, that's part of his 504, so why are you talking to me like he is in trouble? I can absolutely understand the parents who don't give a shit, and teachers feel abandoned, which can be stressful by itself. That is one thing that has been somewhat of an issue though, communication. We constantly e-mail, or text teachers, asking about assignments, and most of the time we won't get a reply for 5 days, if at all. I don't want to hassle them, and know they have a lot to deal with it, but it doesn't really help us when asking about a specific assignment that's due, and he can't remember something about it. I haven't figured  out these teachers just yet. In meetings, they say he is progressing nicely, but then we see a few zeros here and there, and when asked, they just  say he didnt do the assignment. And one of his teachers who we thought was really helping him, replied to an email with a rather nasty tone. It could've been a misunderstanding with the email she received, I'm not sure. My biggest issue honestly is that the behavior complaints. I ask him every day about how his day went, so I know how his behavior was that day, and I don't really want to hear it from the teacher, in that ""you need to do something"" tone. I feel like it's the curriculum that is at fault, it's simply too rigorous. Too fast paced, not allowing enough time for kids to absorb everything. So to me, its like me and all his teachers are in the shit storm together, and should work together.  But I really do appreciate your honesty, and that you realize there are shitty teachers out there as well as those who really care. ",10340,"They can also do a BIP(behavior plan) that can outline if then statements for behavior. For example, if gigi is off task or is distracted, the teacher will redirect and then gigi can...These are done with student, parent, teacher, and the IEP team. These allow an easy way for teachers and your son to work out how behavior will be managed in class. This lets him have some individual choice and makes behavior modification a clear step by step process. Do they use grade book or something like it where grades etc. are posted online? If so, teachers should outline what is due when which might make the assignment thing easier. If he has extended time, and they are giving him zeros, that is against his IEP and isn't allowed. I have also had IEPS that required me to fill out an agenda with work and have it signed by me and the parent. I'm not sure how much the would help, but those are the things I can think of. Don't give up. There are amazing teachers out there, just like there are amazing students like your son.",10341,"Thank you for the advice. I haven't heard of a behavior plan, but i will look into it.

What you're feeling right now is resentment. The question is whether or not you can continue to look past your resentment and ""hate"" for her. To ask yourself if your wife coming around to intimacy now, is better than her never coming around. No one will fault you for leaving now, and no one will fault you for staying and trying to make this relationship work. It is truly your decision to make, you decision of whether or not you can forgive. I don't envy you OP, but I do wish you the best no matter which path you decide to take. After all, we all deserve to be happy.",10378,"I’m in a similar situation.   I went through 12 years of trying to get intimacy from my wife.  And like you it’s wasn’t the physical intimacy that I really wanted.  I wanted a deeper connection with the woman I love; the mother of my 3 kids.  I tried to make her feel special and adored with gifts, flowers, love letters, hidden notes that she’d find, date nights....  She gets overwhelmed so I did more and more cooking, cleaning, yard work, taking care of the kids.... I talked, listened, argued, and yelled.  Nothing seemed to bring us closer.   Resentment built-up.  It felt like love flowed in only one direction.   The more I gave the less I had to give over time.  I was never replenished, only depleted.   Loving her felt like I was losing myself.   

Then I kinda gave up and stopped doing all of these things.  

About a month later, all of a sudden, she wants to work on our marriage.   She said she realizes how hard I tried over the years and that the way she treated me was unfair.  She started initiating sex 2-3 times a week (10-15 times a year was our standard - and she never initiated).  I started getting blowjobs - and she swallowed!!!  Best of all, we finally started really talking to each other. We made time for each other.  Often we would stay up late just to talk.  It was exactly what I was missing.  Everything felt so good.  I was falling in love with her all over again. 

Then I found out about her affair with her coworker.

We recently took a vacation off work and got to spend a lot of time talking to each other in open and honest conversations and it really helped us to reconnect in some aspects of our relationship. Reading your post was a big reality check for me. I could see our marriage getting to the point of resentment if things don’t change. I guess I’m here to say that she may know what she is doing and that it’s affecting you but she may also not be able to help it. I hope that marriage counseling can help you both but if it seems too little too late it may be best to move on and make yourself happy.

When I finally hit the wall she has this come to Jesus moment where she wants to fix the marriage and starts being my BFF and wants to screw around all the time.

I have nothing but pure anger and resentment coursing through my veins and she acts genuinely confused about why if she’s being such a sweetheart now how come I can’t tolerate the sight of her...  sorry, rant off...

It's like it becomes a chore, no one likes chores. So it can be really difficult for men to talk to us about how they feel when we say no to sex or don't feel sexually satisfied, without making it sound like they are saying we owe them sex because their 'man needs' are more important than how we feel.  If you need to have this convo with a girlfriend or wife, definitely be really clear that you do not think that the owe you sex, but that is one of your emotional needs and be open to her suggestions about what she likes sexually and what you could do to help her be in the mood.

Second of all, while this may not be what you wanna hear or need right now, I'd just like to offer a different perspective: OWN your heritage. Like someone else said, wear that badge with pride! I'm Dutch and currently living in the UK (admittedly, only for a year or so), and I'm proud of it. Look at me, having had the guts to move to a different country with a different culture and a different language! Sure, British and American are both English, but one could argue they're different dialects (vocabulary, syntax, accent) and therefore not 100% the same - aka, you moved to a different country with a different culture AND a different language, too! How awesome is that? All the people who never left the UK can't say that. And the British are a weird people, man. But I love them because of it.

I don't try to hide being Dutcb. Usually, people don't pick up on it immediately anymore since my accent is very British/native-like, but I never leave any doubt about it. When they talk about something or use a word I don't understand, I'll ask, and go ""Sorry, non-native speaker/non-English person here!"" with a touch of humour and self-deprecation (love that word! It's one of the words I learned here). They're usually fascinated and interested after that, and in my experience, they're nothing but happy to explain and help me understand. 

I feel much more Dutch here than I do back in the Netherlands, precisely because I'm not in the Netherlands. It's part of my identity and my past and my heritage and goddamn, I'm proud of it (not everything of course, every people and country have their own black pages in history, I'm afraid).

Both the Netherlands and the UK are my home, and you know what? I think it's awesome. It's difficult, too, always standing with one leg in one country and with the other in the other country, but at the end of the day, I think it's awesome, and I'm awesome for moving to this country.

And you're awesome, too. Here's hoping everyone else will start seeing that, too.
",10407,"Ahw cheers! Also, really? Like what/who? :o Yeah of course! Just hope it helps, I know it might not be worth shit right now. But on the off-chance that it could help, I figured I should go for anyway ^^",10408,"We're British. We like talking. We find your background interesting. I'm British Indian, born in England. I get it all the time",10409,How do you feel about bourbons though?,10410,"Haha sounds like a good idea!!! I do have to admit that when I meet people from other countries I ask the same questions 😂 just to build a picture I suppose! Or maybe just being nose! 

I also find it funny when some of my friends from here introduce me to someone else saying “this is x. She is from...”  really bizarre! 

Don’t take it to heart! They (mainly) mean well! ",10411,"I’ve been here 22 years, more than half my life. I apologise when people bump into me. I think “the weather” and “alternate routes to the place you’ve just asked for directions to” are genuinely interesting conversation topics. I can eat Marmite without gagging. 

I still get all of the same questions you’ve listed here, and it’s probably never going to stop. I take it as a compliment - most people asking are genuinely interested, or at the very least trying to find a conversation starter that doesn’t involve the weather. (Glaring exception - I got back from the Florida Keys recently, just missing Irma. All anyone wanted to talk about was the weather. Literally every meeting at work began with an intense Q&A about hurricanes. I was practically a celebrity. I’m still getting questions about it.)

There are a few dickheads who hear my accent and immediately switch on the condescending tones, but  I view it as an opportunity to school them a bit. More often than not, it works. It is annoying when I hear some stupid comment about “‘Murica”, or when someone comments on which hand I hold my knife with, but I’ve learned to pick my battles. Complaining is one of the great British pastimes; sometimes I take a little guilty pleasure in watching the creeping embarrassment when someone realises they’ve just been slagging off Americans right to my face. 

It might be more annoying outside of London (we foreigners aren’t exactly rare here), but I try to view my differences as an advantage. I find I can be a bit more direct in business dealings, for example. I tend to get better service in restaurants - probably because they assume I’ll tip well (true). I tend to have very interesting conversations about politics, and I find people tend to open up to me - it’s probably that reputation Americans have for telling their life stories in the first ten minutes of knowing someone that means I’m more often on the receiving end of this. I guess they’re small things, but they make me happy.

For the most part, I enjoy being a little bit different. I still sound pretty American to the Brits, while everybody back in the US thinks I have an accent. I’ve never tried to lose my accent, and it makes me kind of sad when I hear how some of my fellow expat friends try to sound more British. I personally think it negatively reinforces the idea that one should be ashamed of their differences. The world would be so boring if we were all the same."
0,10434,"i see your point, but know with a solid career behind you your child will have a much better standard of life than if you got pregnant at 21 without finishing school. 
Also dont forget that the relationship you were in ended, there's no guarantee that you would have stayed together had you had a child, so you could have been a single parent right now which would be a much worse scenario. Im sure everything will be fine in the future OP, especially with all the avenues open today (IVF, Surrogate, Adoption Etc)",10436,"I'm 21 and there's not a single chance in the world I could provide everything a child would need. In fact, there isn't a single 21 year old I know that could. 
Raising a child is the single largest expense a person could have, and the vast majority of 21 year Olds don't have the resources to support that expense. 

I think OP is going to be A-OK.",10438,"I think it's because you're the exception to the rule.

It's bad advice to say ""don't worry about finances. You'll figure it out"" to a 21 year old.

Congratulations on getting your shit in order, but it's much more sound; conservative advice to say ""yes. You can wait until you establish yourself financially, you need not rush into raising a family.""",10439,"You fail to notice most 22 year olds do not land jobs making $40k a year, you got lucky. When I was your age I was only making a little over $25k a year in my career. 

With my current insurance plan if I birth a baby today, we're not talking the extravagant cost of 9 months of pregnancy and medical costs in a childs 1st year also, but just to birth a child. $4k. My husband and I make the money to pay that amount but that's still a chunk. I do not think very many 22 year olds can pay that price right this very minute.

You're an exception, you got lucky, very few people your age are able to do what you're doing right now. The cost of college is obscene, it's hard to get your foot in the door directly in to a good paying job, people have to work their way up.

I'm not saying it can't be done but the idea that ""it all works out"" shouldn't be thrown around.

I mean, jeez, the cost of living in most cities, most people can't afford to live on $40k a year with a spouse at home. 

And that whole idea of being physically fit for your kids needs to go out the window. It's a person's choice on their fitness throughout life. I know plenty over overweight, unhealthy 20 something year olds who don't run with their kids. I know plenty of physically fit 30 something year olds that run around with their kids. You can be 30 or 40 and still have more than enough energy to play with your kid if you so choose. Heck, my 50 year old mom can bench press me if she wanted.",10441,"No college debt... you do understand most 22 year olds are either still going through college or they're paying off massive debt from college. Adding medical debt from a baby probably isn't the smartest idea. 

It's very obvious you've struggled to be in a decent position, you dropped out of college, took a $10 an hour job at had a child at 19. You just don't want to admit that struggle was hard as hell and that it would have been easier to have a kid now at 22 when you're established rather than at 19 when you weren't. That's what we're talking about here and you're too busy boasting about you being the exception. You weren't, you're the example we're talking about. 19 years old, no college, $10 an hour job, credit that's barely been established and a lot of fighting tooth and nail WITH a child added on top of that. You're blind if you don't think it would have been better financially and mentally to do all that and for example, wait to have a child at 22. Blind. Regardless of age, it's better to wait to have a child once you're established financially, it's much easier and less stressful. No one said it's impossible, it's just easier.

Even more, I know so very few relationships that started around 19 years of age and survived. You are the exception, you got lucky. Not many people find the love of their life at 19 and no amount of ""hard work"" is gonna land you a wife to have children with at that age.

I'm sure things will turn out fine soon, don't give up -hug-",10446,"I know I'll probably be downvoted for this, but your parents did you a solid. You can still have kids, even if it's through in vitro, or adoption. Your kids are going to have a much better life now than if you had them at 21. 

Honestly, more parents should be like yours. Most parents are trying to get their kids to breed as soon as they meet their SO, and ignores their situation in life.",10447,"I honestly couldn't disagree more. Parents of all shapes and sizes provide for their kids and financial stability is a very small part of that. As long as you have the basics like house, bills paid etc that's fine. Love weighs more than money.

EDIT not to mention the casual reference to IVF which is emotionally draining and a complicated pregnancy can be hell on a relationship and a woman.. Not to mention the expense",10448,"Except for the fact that hardly any 21 year old nowadays has the financial capacity, let alone maturity, to be a parent. My parents are like OP's and I could not be more grateful that they ensured I focus on my career first because now I have a strong financial stability that will provide a good life for my future children. Love doesn't provide food on the table, clothing on their backs, or a roof over their heads.",10449,"Which is why I said 'the basics'. Maturity is deeply subjective; I know 37 year olds who aren't capable of doing jack shit, and one of the best mothers I know was a teenage parent."
0,10465,"I would talk to her about it. Here's something simple you can start with:

> ""Cousin, I wanted to talk to you about something that has been bothering me lately, and I hope you can understand where I am coming from. Lately, it feels like you have been getting closer to me in ways that make me uncomfortable. For instance, you've been putting your hand on my leg."" 

> ""I'm not sure what your intentions are, but it feels like you are trying to initiate a physical relationship. If I am mistaken, I apologize for misunderstanding, but that's just what it seems like when you do things like sit close to me, touch my leg, etc.""

> ""I care very much about you, but I also think that we should have boundaries as family members. I hope you understand how I feel.""

You could also try telling someone else in your family. I can tell that you care a lot about your cousin, but you shouldn't have to be made to feel uncomfortable by a family member.

All I'm saying is, there's not really much difference between her and some lady that's not his cousin. He should consider sleeping with her the same way he considers sleeping with any other woman, which does NOT mean just jumping into it without considering the risks.

Also I even said ""OP can make the choice of whether or not there's a risk of drama/mental health.""

My ex had depression and anxiety, it was really hard to be supportive of her during her lows, especially when it's frequent, it quickly became toxic as she worsened, we worked together, there's nothing I could have done to make her life better, but she could and she did.

Having a partner with mental health issues is an endless uphill battle, setbacks happen and there's little you could do except pick up the pieces and prep your partner and yourself for a counter offensive to retake what was lost, you love your wife very much and the thought of her going back to her shit-house parents would make you feel a lot worse than you currently do now, the bottom line here is that you aren't happy with the way things that are going, especially after having that talk with her about how YOU feel in the position that you are in and it made things worse.

I don't think you've considered going to therapy together, or counciling. They help, hell it just might give her the motivation and confidence needed to take those necessary steps to sort her problems out so she could be more of a partner to you and with your support it would be easier for the both of you, her problems are your problems and it's taking a toll on you, OP.
I 10/10 recommend it.

The thing that happened last time she went to therapy was after a few months she just kinda figured that there wasn't much else that the therapist could tell her to help her out. The therapist gave her tools and things to work on, and she figured she could just work on it herself without the therapy. I'm going to try and get her to stay going longer this time though. And I might eventually go myself too.",10784,"Baby steps are just as good, OP. Do what you're comfortable with.
I can understand why a couples session would be intimidating, it's never good to be in a position where seeing a councillor is an option to help seal up the seam in your relationship before it all gushes out. I guarantee that it would give you the insight needed to help you and your partner to make the changes necessary, I wish it was easier.

You're doing the best you can to support her and hopefully sooner than later you'd reap the rewards that come out of it too, OP.

I understand you feel exhausted holding the fort down and I sympathise I just think she’s in a vicious cycle of negative mental health mixed in with poor organisational skills I believe she would benefit from seeing a therapist that she has a good working relationship with. But if there is something a little more going on that’s a ASD specialist cognitive behavioural therapist. I think your wife would have benefit more if she wrote down a list of things she wanted to achieve to build confidence and someone help her organise what little things she can do to get there. It seems like there is room for improvement in your relationship and although you are exhausted you would be willing to work with her so I would seriously consider having a discussion on these things with her calmly so you don’t end up burned out and shut down yourself.

The soap opera take everyone is caught up here is ridiculous.

The only relevant details a court will look at are danger to you, danger to the child, danger to themselves.

The court will start with the presumption that each parent should be a full and involved parent with the child. And I'd there are mitigating factors (proven drug abuse proven criminal bqckground, proven danger to x, etc) then you go down this road.

Otherwise it's:

- asset and liabilities (house, credit cards, cars, pensions, mortgages, etc) sharing and assumption.

- financial disclosure

- spousal support (how much and how long)

- child support (how much how long)

- age appropriate access schedule if access is not ""on consent""

- details of custody (ranging from sole, shared, joint) and including details like one parent has defacto decision making.

That's what a divorce is.

Dirty laundry, as much as people like to bring it out, unless they're talking about eliminating you, then a judge will ask ""WTF you're including it"" in your application. And your lawyer will say ""what do you want me to do with this?""

Dirty laundry that matters:
- threats
- financial subterfuge/hiding assets
- evidence of unsuitability to be a unrestricted parent (they will always be allowed to be a parent, but they may be restricted).

I think I just broke down a bit- It's not easy to find people in a relatable situation at this age. I'm so sorry for your loss and for all the different emotions that come along with it.*
I know that feeling all too well.  I was 23 when my 62 y/o dad passed.  he had been sick with renal failure and strokes since I was 16.  He finally passed in his sleep 2 days before Christmas 6 years ago.  I stayed home and put off so much of my life to be there for him during his weakness and then help my mom through her grieving and depression for 3 years after.  I helped my mom downsize our large home and find a new place where she could live her 'new normal' and she seemed to really be doing well.  She was active, healthy, spending time with friends, and meeting new people.  I thought I was finally at a place where I could stretch out and begin my adult life at nearly 27.  My long time boyfriend and I moved to a new city half the country away.  I found a new career that I LOVED and I was actually going out on weekends and enjoying my 20's... it was hard to get used to because I was never able to be carefree before.  It was fun while it lasted.  In December '17 it was discovered that my mom needed to have some major-ish surgery to help with some pain in her back.  Nothing too serious.  With me living out of state and no other family to be with her, I suggested she come to my new city and be treated near me.  We have better hospitals and I would be able to spend some time with her while she recovered.  No biggie.  We were looking at a 3 week 'holiday.'  She got here in late January and it was supposed to be 3 or 4 routine test, surgery, 10 days of rehab, home.  Nope! They found major heart problems, unbelievably constricted brain vessels, remnants of past unacknowledged strokes, tumors, and a whole rack of other serious problems.  I still have a hard time understanding since she has always been so healthy.  While trying to come up with a game plan, I was called and told to bring her to the hospital ASAP (last week of May).  The latest test showed she was days away from having a catastrophic heart attack and need emergency quad. bypass surgery.  Luckily, the bypass was a success and heart is doing really well.  Unluckily, after the anesthesia wore off it was obvious she had a major stroke during surgery and she was unable to move or communicate.  She started to improve around her 5th day in the ICU but then stroked out again while I was visiting with her.  She stayed in the ICU for 18 days and was just moved to an Intensive-Acute Rehab Hospital.  She is off most life support but still cannot communicate.  She needs full physical assistance for everything and she has a feeding tube in her stomach.  I feel blessed that she is expected to survive but it is unknown if she will ever recover. The doctors have already suggested I sell her home and move her to a condo near me IF she is able to ever leave nursing care and IF she does, she will most likely need 24/7 care... I am starting to come to terms with the fact that the mother I knew and loved is already gone.  I have no more family.  No more stories to hear from my childhood. No more unsolicited life advice and guidance and unconditional love. No home to go back to.  Sorry for the rambling. It's just isolating, you know.  I definitely know the sadness when thinking about all the life benchmarks my parents will miss.  I know I could be married with kids at 28, but there is simply no time to do such things when caring for your dying parents.  It's not fucking fair",10839,"It really isn't fair, and I am so sorry for what has happened to you and your family.

I remember not long before my dad passed away, I told my friend that “I know that death is inevitable, but I am just not prepared for it. I feel like I am in the age where someone not supposed to experience a death of close family member.”

For a long time I was pretty wrecked both overall and in specific as things would just sneak up on me and I would experience profound memories of loss when something reminded me of it.

As time has gone on I've been able to examine what I think and feel about all of it, leading to me actually recounting nearly everything that happened. It doesn't sneak up on me as much, and when it does It's more a quiet pain than making me break down into tears.

Today I'm able to look back at it all, I'm able to try to figure out if I've romanticised things after the fact (I've decided I haven't).... and while it hurts, especially today, it's become familiar.

> I focus on the pain 

> The only thing that's real 

> The needle tears a hole

> I'm screaming at the top of my voice

> Give me reason, but don't give me choice

As a older person, my experience proves this is a major truth of life. 
You do not still love someone who has such a disregard for you and your children. You just miss the act of being a couple. It's perfectly normal to miss the idea of being with one special person and working twards  a life with a partner. To heal yourself- you need to acknowledge the loss of your marriage and grieve for the lost future together. Then tell the truth to yourself- she was not a true partner and made you unhappy. You have the right to be happy. Once you have grieved the loss and accepted that you want a partner in your life; you will be open to another relationship. Make a list of wanted qualities and a list of unacceptable qualities. You can compromise on the wanted qualities  but never on the unacceptable. (Ex. No cheating ❌ ) Look up and into the eyes of those around you and engage in conversation. Suddenly, you will be happy again and in a stable, healthy relationship that's good for not only you, but your kids. And by then your ex will have had a dose of karma. Happiness is the best revenge. ",10945,"Karma isn't about justice or revenge.  It's about the positive or negative energy that comes into your life from virtuous or malevolent deeds.  

The best example I can give you from my own life was one day at a baseball game I found a wad of cash - maybe 45-50 bucks in small bills.  I thought to myself ""Cool!  Got some good karma today, I guess."" and sat down in my seat. 

In about the 4th or 5th inning I get up for a beer or hotdog and notice there are about 40 or so kids from a camp or something on a daytrip to this game.  I kinda mull it over a bit and realize there's a good chance it was one of these kids who dropped it (all loose bills crumpled up in small denominations) 

So I find the camp counselor and ask him if any kids lost their cash and point out where I'm sitting.  He asks the kids and one of them finally realized what had happened and the two of them came over to me and I was given the opportunity to return that little kid's money. He was crying and clearly really upset, that might have been all the money he had for his next days or weeks at camp.  The sense of relief I could see in him afterwards was remarkable.

The ""good karma"" and the emotional impact it had on me from finding that money was a drop in the bucket compared to the act of returning it.  That positive energy is karma, not the money or getting something I think I might want.

P.S. Totally agree with you on everything else :)",10946,Exactly what I meant. Karma is self generated and self leveling.  Not as clearly written as it was in my head.

But people who belittle others don’t spontaneously get cured from being awful by changing relationships. Ever. ,10952,It is going to be okay. It doesn't seem like it now but it will be in the long run. When you give in to them all the time a woman loses respect for you. I didn't believe this for a long while but you have to stand up for yourself. Even though it may end the relationship. That is important in the future. A relationship that long takes quite a while to get over but it does happen over time.,10953,I'm really hoping that this is the case. I'm falling for a girl that I work with in an office.

Honestly right now I'm terrified to just go knock on their door, I want to give them time and space to grieve and not insert myself into that process until/unless they're ready. I'm going to our apartment office tomorrow to see if the apartment community can set up some kind of support for them. Thank you for reaching out, I really appreciate it!",10974,"Sorry this had to happen.

If it makes you feel any better, you did the right thing. 

",10975,"Definitely check in with them. Maybe bring a small toy or stuffed animal for the little boy. 

As for CPR, it is very physically taxing so the bystanders did have genuine concern for your well being. Not to say that a pregnant woman can’t perform chest compressions but since there was another non-pregnant adult available and able to provide aid, there’s no reason to put yourself through it. ",10976,"I'm planning on going by when the dust has settled and they've had some time to mourn. I feel like my presence so soon after this event would be really raw, or at least it would be for me if the roles were reversed. Also I'm glad that that man stopped me from trying to attempt CPR, it was just bizarre, I think that was the first time in months I just totally forgot that I was pregnant. My whole world has been about carrying this baby and I just...forgot. I really thought for an hour or two after this happened that I was going into labor but I think it was just the adrenaline cooling off. I'm so glad I wasn't alone and there were better, more capable people than me there that could do compressions. ",10977,"Its going to mean a lot to her that you and the man came to her aid. You had no chance of changing the outcome, but she felt your humanity in her time of need. ",10978,"Thank you very much for the support. I just hate that doing ""everything you can"" in reality is so little. I'm very glad I wasn't alone and that other people were there and stepped up to try to save him. I hate the outcome. ",10979,"First off, yes it must have been a horrifying thing to watch BUT........... all that could be done was done. Bystander CPR was started. That CPR while not successful would have helped maintain oxygen levels in his system in the hope that the Paramedics could have revived him. Sadly in this and most cases CPR won’t work.
Yes it was distressing but take solace in the fact that all that could have been done was in fact done. You did all you could as did those performing CPR.
Good luck with the birth of your baby",10980,"Thank you for your kind words, they are greatly appreciated!",10981,"I’m so sorry that you have experienced something so traumatic. Unfortunately I experienced something similar about 8 years ago, and am still slowly making peace with it. I really hope you can find closure. "
0,10988,"Was in the same sea as you; just a different boat.
Husband of almost 10 years (together for 17) and bff since childhood.  She supported me and stayed with me the first 2 months after he left.  Then she just dropped me.  To spend time with him.  Difference was that he had zero interest in her.  But she chose him over our friendship.  All she had to do was be my friend.  I would have never in a million years behaved that way towards someone I cared about.
 
It was beyond devastating.  I lost the person I was to spend the rest of my life with and made vows to do so AND the person I thought was like a sister to me.

I wrote her off as a terribly difficult lesson to learn.  
That life is challenging and people come and go at the drop of a hat.  Embrace who you are.  Love who you are.  Change what you feel you need to within yourself.  
This all happened last November.  It has absolutely changed me for the better.  It took a long time, mind you.

Months of sobbing and wanting to end the pain.  Watching my whole world take a shit and I was left scared to death of where I was headed now.

But something just snapped.  After many self analyzing nights and days, I found what a true friendship should be and how a real relationship should work.   I was not the problem.  The root of me was not.  I’m sure I contributed but in small ways that I could have corrected it given the chance at communicating them.

You had a bad friend.  And a bad boyfriend.  Live your life to spite them both and be happy.  Eventually.  
But you can and you will.  I’m not in a new relationship or have a new bff.  When the time comes for either, I am confident that I will be the very best for both.  

I wrote her off immediately when I found out.  There was no way in hell I was going to talk about it with her.  There was no point.  I could never trust her again.  
As for him.....well...I’m just a fool who is still holding onto something that may be long gone.  

I’m sorry this happened to you.  It will not permanently break you.  I promise you.   
Allow it to open your eyes and your heart to truly appreciate what you do have no matter how small or silly you think it may be.  Your dog will be there to help you.  And if you need to talk..please message me.  

Apologies..on phone and lack of sleep.  Holidays are hard man.  But you got this.  

From one shattered heart to another..
Xox",10989,"What you are going through is traumatic. You have been hurt and manipulated by people who were supposed to love you, protect you. I understand you are feeling alone, worthless.

You think he's spending all this time and obviously spending money on her snd HER KID out of ""friendship""? Most men (relax, I said most not all) don't do such things unless expecting something in return. And why the secrecy? Why not be honest about the whole thing if it were so innocent? I know you don't want to think that these two people you've trusted for so long are capable of this deceit, but it sadly happens all the time. This is just my opinion,  but if I were you, and as hard as it would be, I'd cut them out of my life completely. Realize you're worth much more than how they've treated you.",10994,"He was spending the night with her several times a week, and they're trying to convince you they weren't having sex? They've already proven themselves to be liars. Please, don't set yourself up for more hurt by trusting this transparent bullshit. I know it's hard, but you need to step back and look at this rationally. Their relationship is almost certainly what broke up your engagement. You need to get angry, go no contact, and start taking care of yourself.",10995,:(,10996,"I had something very similar happen to me a year and a half ago. 
It involved my best friend needing to ""console"" my ex boyfriend after we had broke up and after he had done some pretty idiotic things by telling him she hoped I hadn't ""made up"" some very private and pretty grim details I had divulged to her about me and my ex's relationship. 
My ex does not give a toot about her and told me straight away about what she had been saying. Obviously he knew he had done them.
She texts him ocassionaly to tell him she misses him still apparently. 

Me and my ex are on vaugly good terms as he was helpful after we split up and I was dealing with some other pretty shocking stuff. 

I saw her for the first time last weekend and it was probably one of the most uncomfortable experiences. I honestly never, ever want to see her again. She was incredibly apologetic about it all and told me how much she loved me and missed me. 
She really turned on me in one of the most vulnerable periods in my life. I will never trust her again. But I managed to stay calm and just nod. I have no anger anymore but no love either. Just a sort of beige

Since I moved away from them after I got over my initial trauma nasty period of doing lots of sobbing, going to the doctor and taking some meds to give me the ability to take a step back.  I started doing things just for me. I came off the meds after a couple of months and started doing lots to sort myself out mentally and physically  (yoga, vitamins, good dinners - lots of doggo stuff)
 I really thought I would never get out of the dark place I was in after the hurt of being turned on by the people I thought loved me most. 

I did. I feel good. Honestly. Not everyday but more often than not now. I'm glad I've got those people gone. That's not a friend. That's something else. 

I'm so sorry this has happened and I know this time of year makes it so much worse. 
I never thought I would be OK, but I am. I'm better than OK. It just took time to get there. 

Thinking of you internet stranger. 
",10998,"You should probably talk to her, try to understand what could make her hurt you in such a way.
If you aren't happy with her answer and theres no justification then you should stop wasting your energy on people who don't deserve it. 
There's no point in keeping toxic people in your life it only brings you down.",10999,"She's sent me a whole bunch of messages saying how bad she feels how sorry she is, how she couldn't bring herself to tell me, how she didn't have the courage to choose between us. How she didn't know she was capable of such despicable things and she knows she's been the worst friend blabkabla

It just hurts even more.

I never asked her to choose between us. All it would have taken was for her to message me saying ""he wants to come over is that alright"" 

Or to just tell him to talk to me about it.

But they're cowards and preferred lies and deceit. 

She says none of it was calculated but it all was. The timing, the paying in cash...

I just wasn't worth enough.",11001,"Maybe you should tell her that all she had to do was be honest with you and that after all these years of friendship she owes you that decency and respect. 
You could forgive them but how would it make you feel to be hanging out with the two of them together?",11002,"I've told her that. She said ""I know I know but I was weak, I saw how upset you were about the break up and I didn't have it in me to tell you"".

I don't know if I could ever forgive either of them.

0,11008,Working people are the only reason they're rich,11009,They’re,11010,"I agree with you. It wouldn't be so bad if they could just leave others alone about it. They feel entitled to tell people how to live.

My ex's mother brags about how she's self made... Yet she was given a college education, and given start-up capital, got five grand given to her every year, plus presents of cars, TVs, and 50-80k for house down payments. 

She doesn't understand how anyone could possibly not be small business owners because, ""all it takes is some hard work"".

Totally clueless.",11011,"I live in a pretty wealthy neighborhood. My parents got in early, and are not as wealthy as most of my neighbors.

I mean, it's great that you are busting ass to get a degree. But guess what? Once you have that degree you're probably just gonna be working for another business owner. Are you going to envy them?

0,11024,you need a restraining order against him. I'm so sorry.,11025,You're absolutely right. That's the conclusion I keep coming too. I really hate bringing police and the legal system back into it anymore than I have to in the last year. But at the same time he is unstable and I need to set safe boundaries for my daughters sake. I have no more energy left to waste feeling like I did anything besides love my little baby girl with all my heart.,11026,you absolutely have to.,11027,"The word restraining order is scary for me -- when he filed divorce he also filed a BULLSHIT retraining order keeping me from having any contact with my toddler, for A month. He took advantage of the fact that autopsy reports hadn't come in and he was ""afraid I'd hurt our baby and might do something to our other child"". I almost ran into oncoming traffic when I read it and realized I was powerless until the hearing. 

I told myself I'd not do the same thing to him. 
However, I have also grown so much in the past 16 months and he's still as broken as he was the day it happened. ",11028,"I am so sorry for your loss. I don't know why the medical examiner did not go with Sudden Infant Death Syndrome to the death certificate, since genetic factors plays a role. Regardless, it is not your fault.

I hope you're able to get the support you need. Combined losing your child and how your ex is acting, I can't imagine how incredibly taxing that would be on you. Hoping for a brighter future for you",11029,"I had a long talk with the medical examiner about his findings. His exact words were ""because I was co-sleeping and by my statement she was sleeping against my chest he felt the only explanation was suffocation"". When I asked if he would have put the same explanation if she had been in a bassinet he said no then he would have put SIDS. He told me point blank he believes co-sleeping was to blame. 

I don't accept that. I know how to co-sleep with my babies and I realize accidents happen but I didn't smother my child.
I've been told that when babies can't breath they won't fight it and will just....die. But in my heart of hearts that isn't what happened with my girl.
It's hard to explain to anyone that wasn't there (so no one) but the way she was laying when I awoke, the way her body ultimately lay in death, everything felt like she just fell asleep and never woke up......... ",11030,"Ugh. I am so sorry. I feel angry for you since I agree from your post that co-sleeping isn't the cause. Perhaps you can reach out to support groups to talk about this? Wish you well

And that's the moment I knew my living daughter had to be my sole focus. 

",11033,"> there was nothing but hate left for me

Could be projection on his part.

You said he didn't help on raising the first child, he then promised he'd help with the second, he didn't do that either.

And the night before he again did not participate but did his own thing, for himself only. ""try to keep the girls crying to a minimum because he was at a good point in his show and that would kill his vibe.""

So I think at least part of that hate is about him and about his own shotcomings.",11034,"You're absolutely right. 

He'll go a week or so being civil with me and then all it takes is a bad day for him and bam I'm getting texts about how he should've taken me to jury trial.

I keep telling myself that I'm the one who went from a stay at home mom to working full time only 2 months after she passed and have not only maintained that job but been promoted many times. 

Meanwhile he keeps jobs for a week or so, quits in a blaze of anger, and spends all free time thereafter terrorizing me. ",11035,"You know, EVEN IF co-sleeping was the culprit, and (I'm absolutely not saying it was), that kind of behaviour from him is pretty transparently projection. He didn't do shit for your infant daughter and he feels guilty about that on some level. It's probably also pretty comforting for him to be able to console his useless failure shitass for not being able to hold down a job for longer than the run of a single season of a Netflix original to be able to say to himself ""well I may not be able to support myself and my family but at least I didn't KILL A BABY.""

Because that's how people like your ex measure their own self-worth. Not by their own accomplishments, but by the failures of others. In the absence of the failures of others, they *make shit up*.

This was not your failure, OP. Please know this. You obviously had nothing but love for your children and you were a good mom. The way your ex is dealing with his own grief is toxic, and I worry about the level of care he can provide for your other daughter, and what he will say to her when they're alone together. Your lawyer should be aware of what's going on."

You will grieve a life you thought you would one day have. There is nothing I can do or say about that. But you can still have an incredible life.

I was angry, bitter, jealous, and at times down right hateful for a good while after receiving my diagnosis.

Some people have shit holes for kids despite what they do, and you don't get a break for 18 years. No more date nights, vacations are much more expensive or non existent, the adults you see often get limited to the parents of other kids. Much less money to spend on yourself. Not to mentions the horrors and pain of pregnancy. Months of suffering with no relief.

Sorry to ramble. I'm kinda buzzed and my grade-school sensibilities of ""fair"" and ""not fair"" are way too strong right now.

In the song she says “I don’t know why I’m scared, ‘cause I’ve been here before. Every feeling, every word. I’ve imagined it all.” That’s how I felt about it.

0,11095,"Amen !

I feel like most people who downvotes us are THOSE kind of parents who think they are the kings/queen of the world and that we owes them everything.

Hopefully, there’s still some parents who have a head on their shoulders and know that nice restaurants and peaceful resorts are not for young kids and that everyone surrounding them are NOT free babysitters (worked in a retail store about 5-6 years ago. Some people would bring their kids in and let them wreck everything thinking that we would do their parent’s job.)

",11096,"I totally understand where you're coming from. I have a 3 year old with another baby on the way, and I do my best to make sure my kid doesn't affect other people's lives as much as possible. We don't take him to fancy ""grown up"" restaurants, we do diners, and we DEFINITELY don't let him run wild. We wouldn't allow him to splash people in the pool at a resort (we haven't been to one, so we haven't had the chance!). People say we're too strict with him, we're not. He has free reign to go nuts at home or at the park or at his grandparents' houses. Outings are not that time, and he knows that.

All that being said, I don't hate the kids. They don't know any better. I hate their parents for not instilling life skills into their kids, for taking the easy way out, and for being lazy at the expense of everyone else's comfort. A kid's job is to push boundaries in order to learn, a parent's job is to hold fast on boundaries so that they raise good adults.",11097,"AMEN !!

It’s the same for my kids, and my mom was acting the same (even stricter) towards my sisters and us when we were young.

It is not called being strict... It’s called being respecful of other’s environment and acting civilized.

Unfortunately, nowadays, most parents don’t seem to care about the behaviour of their children anymore. All they seem to want is to relax when they are not working. Well, if you want kids you have to take your responsibilities and to act like a parent.

Hopefully, there is still some parents like you and I who are respectful and who cares for our little ones.",11098,"My in-laws think we're ""too strict"" with our son because we *gasp* make him eat real food for dinner and drink...dare I say it...*WATER* instead of juice!! Don't even get me started on the abuse of not letting him turn into a wild animal and remain calm while inside playing. I don't take it to heart, though. They're just typical grandparents. My parents are much more realistic, and love our parenting style! My dad is always super impressed with how well behaved our son is, and then I remind him that I've never taken shit from anyone, and I'm not starting with my own kid.

My secret is that I started young. I had rules and expectations when he was really young. Like, less than 18 months old. Granted, they were things like holding hands, not wandering off, don't touch things without asking, etc. As he got older, they became more complex. Now that he's 3, he's fully aware that mom and dad have strict expectations and that following them is his best course of action. Yes, we're in the ""no"" phase right now, but he knows what's up. He's a smart kid.

That being said, for every ""mean parent"" moment he goes through, there are about 50 hugs, kisses, and giggle fits, so it's more than balanced!

I'm so glad to hear that another parent feels the same!!! I feel so alone sometimes, and some people make me start to question if I'm too strict. In my heart I know I'm not, but it's that little feeling sometimes that gets to me. ",11099,"Trust me, you’re a good mom !

I wish I had better/actual advice to offer, but goddamn, that just sounds rough. My mom struggled a lot raising my brother and I, and that was with child support from our dad (albeit, nearly half as much per month as her lawyer wanted her to get, because she's way too soft) so I can only imagine how trying it must be without that little bit of money to help.

I was on antidepressants for 15 years. I've been off them for 5 years. I never want to go back on them. My tough times are tougher, but my good times are better. I hated all the side effects and how they numbed me to things. I have learned to like the pain I feel because it motivates me to make changes rather than being complacent. I'm not in your shoes and I don't know all the details so I can't make the call for you---but if you can, try to use the pain as motivation to push you through the bullshit and help you make positive changes. Maybe it means exploring a wider range of options for daycare. Maybe it means looking for a new job that gives you higher pay with fewer hours.

And you're saying her depression means she's sick and needs medication? Who the hell *wouldn't* be feeling weighed down with heavy depression and anxiety in her situation? ",11167,"Perhaps ""sick"" was a poor choice of words.  That said, she told us that she'd been feeling much better before she stopped the meds, so to me at least it seems like they were helping her cope.  My point is more that for some reason, people see mental un-wellness (whether caused by some sort of chemical or hormonal imbalance, or by total shit outside circumstances) as something to be ashamed of when they wouldn't hesitate to take meds that helped their physical well-being.  OP seems like she's trying her best to stay strong and keep from being swept out to sea.  If those meds were helping her feel better, there's no more weakness in taking them than there is in taking aspirin when stress causes a headache. Anxiety isn't a sickness, you're right, but it's still damaging to the body and mind both, and there are meds that can offer some relief."
0,11168,"Much of Western society does not have a healthy attitude towards sex, primarily because there's so much emphasis on it.  Rather than treating it as a natural part of life, sex is shoved into public consciousness as much as possible, and only one emotionless type at that.  I can understand why you dislike porn because it focuses a lot on showing dominance and aggression towards women, and expecting them to just take it.  There's not a lot of porn where there's an equal exchange of pleasure and affection.  People don't like feeling used, especially during sexual activity because that is when they're vulnerable.


",11169,"Absolutely. I probably do have a lot of bitterness in that way as a victim of sexual assault. I may actually be much more open to the type of porn that actively avoids that, even if the nudity still hits me right in the insecurities. That is not all but definitely part of the problem for me. ",11170,sex sells,11172,Thank you. I really needed that.,11173,"It bothers me so much. You enter a porn webpage, the first thing you see are women being fucked in very uncomfortable positions,   looking very uncomfortable themselves, in questionable contexts, restrained and denigrated. The title is always ""slut gets gang raped"" ""whore gets fucked hard"" ""teen fucked by old man"" or something worse.

Porn is centered around the male orgasm and pleasure, ending right after a man orgasms, while the woman cums loudly and repeatedly (heh) just from penetration. But sex in real life does not end when a man orgasms, nor is it the main and only objective of sex. You are not limited to tits and a pussy - there are other erogenous zones in our bodies that cause just as much if not more pleasure. There is not just one way to get a woman off.

A woman can enjoy sex without being a slut or a whore. A woman deserves to feel pleasure in the sexual activities she partakes on, just as a man does, and constantly showing porn in which women are clearly not having a good time while being treated like an object is not sex positive. No part of porn reflects the need to include women's sexuality into the mix. At best, we're shoved to a ""softcore erotica corner"" and told to stop complaining because ""our brains are wired differently"".

And finally, a lot of the porn out there is published without consent of the people in it, something most of the viewers seem to not even think about or consider twice. Sometimes, celebrity nudes are leaked without permission, and a whole subreddit gets dedicated to publishing and distributing them despite said celebrity clearly stating their disagreement.

So I absolutely agree with you that the current porn industry is awful towards women, that it's not positive nor healthy, and that it needs a lot more change to a point in which we can say it is. I'm not saying porn shouldn't exist - I like good porn. But the current industry is fucked up and that needs to be adressed. 

And no OP, you're not a paranoid monster for not liking porn - you are entitled to have your own opinion based on your views and experience, and not because a random bunch of redditors say you're wrong does it mean you are.",11175,As someone who has been told to leave because of having a small penis.

",11246,Very true! ,11247,"As someone who has spent way too many years working in a field that often deals with the same people you do, I can give you one piece of advice to help you keep your sanity: focus on the positive. 

When someone asks how your day was, tell them about the good stuff. You got a domestic violence victim out of her house at least for a night. That’s one night she won’t wake up in the morning with new bruises. You made sure an old man was going to have a good meal. You saw people bust their ass to help someone they didn’t know and had never seen before. You stopped at that new burger spot and they’re surprisingly good. 

Glaze over the bad stuff with a “Some not so good things happened too. But that’s what happened today.” 

You’re doing two things; sheltering the people who don’t have to deal with the things you do from having to battle it without the professional support mechanisms in place that you do, and you’re giving them ammunition on those really bad days. They’ll be able to point out so many good things that have happened it will take some of the sting out of those truly shitty days. 

And when you leave that job at retirement or because you find something else, those good stories are the ones that will matter and you and your partner and spouse can revel in those. ",11248,That is very good advice! I am so appreciative that you took the time to respond! Thank you so much! I hope you have found your peace too!,11249,"I have. I changed careers into something that still lets me do what I do best without all the emotionally abusive stuff. And now when I look back on that life, I remember the heartwarming stuff like wiener dog races that had 300 people show up to raise money for a little girl who needed a kidney.  I remember the pilot who flew a retired military dog from a shelter across the country to his handler in Afghanistan. The bad stuff is blurry and distant almost all of the time. 

So yeah, I hope you give that a shot and that it works for you. ",11250,Thank you for what you do. God bless you ,11251,No need to thank me! I’m just venting (:

I’m sure he knows people who could be good friends with you!",11273,"Have you checked out meetup.com? I don’t know how active groups are in your area but there’s usually at least one or two groups where people are looking to just hang out. Take it slow, and don’t expect every interaction to be a home run, but it will expose you to more social interactions. Do you have hobbies? Finding like-minded people and interacting with them when the focus is on a mutual interest can be a lot easier than straight up talking to someone.

To become more comfortable just talking to people, try to pay someone a compliment as you pass them...”hey, I love that shirt!” Or something similar. Don’t expect a response or conversation, don’t stop them to do it, but it will help you become more comfortable just talking aloud to people. We tend to get into our own heads a lot and the fear of saying something “wrong” can be paralyzing. By throwing out something you can get used to that initial talking aloud part.

Crosspost your story over at other subreddits like /r/TwoXChromosomes or /r/relationships and even /r/legaladvice. Tons of knowledgeable people who can give you helpful tips for the next few days and weeks.

I had to explain to her that maybe I don't do a lot of traveling with her, but my dad's family wants me to travel, my friends want me to travel, and if I have a gf at any given time, she wants me to travel.  I simply do not have the time and money to do all this.  Not to mention every time there's a birthday I have to spend money on a restaurant because it doesn't occur to one side of the family that there may be stuff going on with the other side as well. 

The best thing you can do is explain it to them. You are not greedy for wanting time to yourself.  It's your life to live, not anyone else's. ",11399,"Thanks for this reply, you really get it.  And exactly, I just get angry with how selfish my parents can be about it. They KNOW I navigate this shit regularly but don’t seem to really care because they loathe their ex.  That’s the part which really sucks. I’m sorry for your situation too man, but promise yourself you won’t lose yourself in the shuffle. I didn’t even add the pressure for plans with friends and trying to maintain my own relationships. I end up so burned out I just want to be alone. 

I guess I just feel sad I’m always going to carry this burden. No matter how many times I say we can’t, or no, even with notice or in a nice way someone’s feelings get hurt. I have to constantly hear disappointment and it gets really fucking old.  Just this past week my MIL was babysitting and commented on how we told her no for a weekday concert but made time to go to one with my FIL.  Uh yeah, because he just bought tickets and we had no choice. You at least pretend to care we have lives and ask before you purchase. We once even attended the same musical, at the same theatre, a day apart, and didn’t post to social media because my husbands parents each got us the same gift one Xmas and he didn’t want to pick tickets from one or the other because of the guilt of having the conversation and letting one down. Like, fuck man! 

Forget birthdays and holidays like Mother’s Day and Father’s Day and the coin I’m expected to drop on that. Then the holidays too? Christmas is a nightmare. Enough to make my head spin. 

But you’re right. I have to say no and then say why and if they get upset eventually tell them that I get their disappointed but please hide it from me. They never gave a shit on their every other weekend schedule when one parent ripped me away from my friends and house and life. I just had to feign enthusiasm for their benefit. 

And so, it continues.
",11400,"Oh boy, it wouldn't be Christmas without both your mom and your dad getting mad at you for seeing the other parent now would it be? (In actuality you're just trying to see them both and don't even get to enjoy it yourself). Also my high school and college graduations were so much fun cause instead of just enjoying myself I had to keep my families separate and try to dedicate an equal amount of time to them. 

But yeah in all seriousness, you just need to set boundaries.  They're trying to guilt use and use the fact you're feeling bad to get what they want. Keep setting the boundaries and they'll learn it doesn't work (ashame though that you have to use the same techniques for disciplining a child on grown adults). 

Also another technique you could try is to make it unpleasant for them when they try to guilt you.  For example:
Mom: you spent the weekend with your father last weekend, why won't you make time for me?
Bad response: sorry mom I've been busy, I'll come over and do whatever you want blah blah blah 
Good response: do you have any fucking idea how many people I need to please, for chrissakes no one ever thinks about me I've been running myself ragged trying to keep you all happy.....

You don't have to be as explicit, or use the same language as I did, The idea is to make it unpleasant for them to use this strategy so they avoid it. ",11401,"Well and then we never invite anyone over to see us at home because our parents want everything on THEIR terms and we are so desperate to enjoy our own family dynamics and life we just act like hermits. Are your parents this way? This leads me back down the path that my parents are both inherently extremely selfish. It’s very difficult, and my mother, for example, has horrible boundary issues with her own parents. She has one of those parent-friendship mind fuck relationships and I can tell is bummed I refuse to partake in the same fuckery with her. No, my idea of vacation isn’t hanging out at your house while you talk trash about family members you think you’re superior to, Linda.

Thanks so much for identifying with me today. It’s hard to express this with certain people who don’t have family or don’t live with constantly trying to make everyone happy. It’s likely an older child trait,  but I need to get better about it.

God, it’s like I was talking about Christmas/college myself. I really feel for you. I have always loved Xmas but my husband is emotionally scarred from it. His family traditions meant his mother always woke up alone on Xmas and he’d be dropped off to her crying on Xmas day that she was alone.  We had a really hard time adjusting to even more pressure (4 families, all who think they’re most important) and so we spent years with Xmas eve here for half the day, then here half the day, then 3 stops Xmas day! My husband proposed to me on Xmas morning and told me he did it this way so we could reclaim the holiday as ours and to give us a happy memory. Man, I could cry writing this right now that’s how special it was to me.

My wedding was a waking nightmare, it was the first time all of our families had to interact for DECADES. Got into arguments with my mother about who my real father was, fight of my life about walking down the aisle with just Dad. I finally snapped and said “it was my day, my one day to pretend to be normal and you couldn’t even give me that without pain. Fake for me, please. Stop telling me this is your day too. I just want one hour of feeling like a normal person” Ex in laws and ex daughter in laws, vice versus, plus our parents all meeting one another and their partners. Then the kids came and everyone had to play nice again. Thankfully I set the expectation early that if I even hear them talking shit about the other parent in front of my kids they will lose privileges to spend time. I don’t need my kids all fucked up because of them. That’s my job to do! 😂 

",11402,"Well I still live at home, primarily with my mother, so I don't really have experience with having a life away from them, but I do quite often feel the need to ""escape"" when some boundaries are being crossed.  

But yeah, it's really nice to identify with someone else who goes through something similar.  I see all my friends who can just have a normal Christmas, a normal graduation, and I get so jealous. Like why couldn't I have that? Why couldn't I just have a normal, middle class childhood? If I ever do get married, I think I'd go somewhere with my fiancé and just get married to two of us, to avoid all that family bull shit.  From the tone of your post, I'm inferring that things weren't pretty either, and without going into detail, a lot of shit from my childhood wasn't either. 

Also I just want to say it's incredibly commendable that you want to ensure your kids don't get caught up in it.  I can attest that growing up in the situation I did definitely caused me some issues that linger into adulthood. I've vowed that if I ever have kids (which honestly I'm starting to think I won't, for other reasons), I will make sure they won't deal with this. ",11403,"Yes, there’s a certain number of trust/acceptance I tend to seek from others which isn’t entirely healthy.  And yes, being a parent has been hard too. It’s sort of opened my eyes to how poorly prepared my parents were to have children. It’s also insane how much they pump themselves up as selfless and amazing.  Definitely not the case.

The pressure in advance of the wedding was really hard but the actual event was amazing. I got the day I wanted because I fought for it and I’m proud of myself for that!",11404,"My parents are divorced as well, my step-dad also has an ex. The one thing my family has been good about is putting their kids ahead of their problems. When my step-sister comes to town to visit, her mom and dad are together to spend time with her. Some of the decisions my dad makes drive my mom crazy, but they still talk on the phone and can be in the same room together.

My last gf found it kind of strange that everyone can seem to get along with their ex, but everyone really just put their kids ahead of relationship problems. It sucks that they seem fine putting so much stress on you.",11405,"Dude, epic handle. Hope it’s a sweet Zappa reference.

Yeah, civility in the name of your children is critical. I can give my husbands parents some credit. They really respectfully talk about one another around their kids but FIL acts like MIL is dead essentially. This is hard because it’s just conversation that doesn’t happen. It’s even weirder when these divorced people have so much in common they buy you similar gifts and have similar interests they’d like to include you in. 

My parents are savages in the worst way. I’m glad your family is able to put it aside for you. Cherish that man!"

It is challenging and sometimes frustrating to get asked things like this over and over. Or know that they’re probably thinking something if not saying it.

However, no person is perfect, no relationship is perfect, and I know that when my husband says these things to me, it is his fear and anxiety talking. I love him very much and accept that this is part of who he is and the experiences that have shaped him, for better or worse. 

Hug him when he gets home, apologize once, and take a deep breath. He really does mean it’s all good.",11454,"Me and my girlfriend joke around like this all the time, and we never take it seriously.

All I’m trying to say is that I empathize, and forgiveness should be given all around. 

I also grew up in a situation where I didn’t have a voice. Even now I hardly ever yell, so I understand where you’re coming from.

I can relate to the lack of friends...I’m quite anti-social myself.  Not because I can’t make friends, I just don’t have the energy for it, I guess.  It sucks ass!  

You husband might not be cheating on you physically but it definitely sounds like he is cheating on you emotionally.  I’m not the jealous type but even this would get my blood boiling.  I know you say he isn’t cheating on you but all the red flags, neon signs and shouts from the rooftops are are loud and clear.  At least to this outsider POV they are.  I don’t know how you are not seeing it.  It sounds like he is taking your trust for granted.  

Lastly, don’t hate yourself...hate what is happening right now.  

If you need to chat, you can PM me anytime.  ",11506,"I take it he knows you have access to his phone, correct?  If there was something going on, do you think he would be stupid enough to leave evidence on his phone?  He is at the *very* least emotionally cheating on you!  And I wouldn’t be the least bit surprised if it was physical, as well.  He has only been “friends” for a week and is already using all kinds of excuses.  If I wasn’t on my phone, I’d highlight each of them for you.  Nobody in a committed relationship deserves this!   YOU deserve better!

Eight years is a long time for daily drinking so you should be extremely proud of yourself for going a week without any alcohol.  Let’s shoot for two weeks!",11508,"If they talk so much during the day, when they should be working, what could possibly be left to talk about until the wee hours of the morning?  It’s not like they are long lost friends that lost touch for years and are trying to catch up.  They only met one week ago!  

The intimacy HAS slowed down between you and your husband, at least during the last week since they met.  You said yourself that he had spent more time with her than with you.  The excuses to spend time with her are ridiculous. It’s understandable that you are not seeing it but you are in some serious denial about what he might be doing.  I’m not trying to hurt you, I’m hoping you’ll see what is right under your nose so you don’t get hurt any more by him.   YOU. DON’T. DESERVE. THIS FROM. HIM!!",11510,"Have you checked every app on his phone?

I had a friend cheating on her husband, and they both had access to each other's phones. She would text with the guy normally to make sure the husband had no proof of any cheating, but they would talk about intimate things in some random game app that also had a bit of messaging. There was set of code words for them to know to look in the game instead, but the conversation would appear normal when her husband checked her texts.

I agree - as much as I hate saying this, there is at least emotional stuff going on.",11511,"Given the information you gave us, I would be VERY suspicious of this relationship. It's far too intimate and exclusive of you.

Red flags I noted:

-he spends more free time with her than you, his wife.

-he doesn't communicate often with you when he's with her, not checking his phone.

-he's leaving you looking after your step-son (HIS child) while he hangs out like a single man.

-every time you try to meet her properly it gets cancelled.

-he went to meet her for a couple of hours and STAYED OUT ALL NIGHT. All night! A married/committed person doesn't pop out to see a friend and stay out until 6am.

That's more red flags than a Chinese parade. If he's not already cheating (which, I'm sorry, I think he is), he's having an inappropriate relationship with a newly single woman who is looking for comfort. Consider asking him to put boundaries on the relationship and insist on meeting her properly to gauge how they interact, and make the idea that he has a wife real in her eyes, which up until now she seems to be ignoring.",11512,Oh my god u/SufficientlyStinky I didn’t even see all your comments before I replied. These are humongous neon red signs flashing a mere inch in front of your face. Jesus h Christ this sounds really bad. If I were you I would’ve told him to stop talking to her weeks ago!!!,11513,"You know, it’s okay have boundaries of what you want in a relationship. You don’t have to accept this behavior. Your husband can have friends and still treat you with respect. 

Telling you he will be back in 2 hours and disappearing until you call him is not respectful. Telling you he’s going over to her house to drop something off and disappearing for the whole night?! Without a word to you? Even if all this is totally innocent (which honestly I suspect it’s not) that is still not okay! 

You don’t have to be a doormat to be a good wife. It doesn’t mean you are jealous or controlling if you say, “I’m glad you have a friend but I need you to have healthy boundaries with her.” You clearly aren’t happy with the situation and I’m not so sure I agree that it’s because you have no friends. 

If you had friends and occasionally saw them, you’d be happy with your husband completely ignoring you like this? You’d be okay with coming home from dinner with a friend and your husband refusing to answer his phone or tell you when he’d be home and not showing up until 6 in the morning? 

It’s normal to want your husband to put you first. Friends are great and everyone should have time with their friends but your spouse is the one you decided to spend your life with and they still come first. ",11515,"I think that even if this was a new male friend the behavior is not ok.  Calling off work because he stayed out too late?  Spending more time with his friend than both his wife AND his son?  Not being there to even KNOW you have over a week of sobriety, let alone celebrate with you?  Sure, the fact that this new friend is female casts a completely different pallor on the situation, but even if the friendship is completely platonic, I think it's crossed some boundaries and it's ok to tell him so.",11516,"He stayed at a gas station with her until 6 in the morning? That doesn’t seem like an odd story to you? 

If you tell him what you are feeling, why is he continuing with this behavior? Why isn’t he making his relationship with you a priority? And you mentioned a stepson, when is he spending time with his child? 

All this just sounds so strange. I’ve seen in your post and your comments that you are so convinced this isn’t an affair but I don’t really see how you are so sure honestly. Just because you haven’t found texts? He could still easily be having an affair. How are you so sure they didn’t go back to her place that night he supposedly spend the entire time at a gas station?

Thirdly, most accomplishments are intangible but move the gears of history. Nothing is accomplished fast, and what I’ve learnt is that changing attitudes is the first step towards changing society. Making someone think of something differently, abandon bigotry, love themselves more, whatever it is - that, in the long run, changes society at large. See how the fear of LGBT made people turn out in 2004 elections and within 10 years LGBT gained acceptance in society in America.

0,11593,"Hey there! I got married in February as well. While it didn't happen to me personally, I know countless women that went through what you did. The other day I had a good friend mourn about the details of her day and how she wishes it would've gone differently (her's was in October). I'm sorry you had to endure that. But here's what I learned through my engagement/wedding journey that will hopefully help your perspective! 

After a couple months of feeling uncertain, anxious and stressed about being a bride, I picked up the book The Conscious Bride by Sheryl Paul. One of the main points she stresses is our society's completely skewed priority of the wedding day over the actual marriage - the most important and sacred part! 6 months before the wedding I committed to looking forward to becoming wife, not a bride. By the time the day rolled around, I had zero expectations. I let my hair blow in the wind, I laughed at the drama, I replied to my mom ""it's a small detail that doesn't matter,"" to majority of her issues she presented to me, and that attitude made me genuinely enjoy the day. Oh, also, the best man cut our cake in accident, lol.

But I realize I was one of the lucky ones who discovered how to embrace this perspective BEFORE my wedding. So many women don't, and that's why theres this phenomenon called ""post-wedding depression."" You focus so much on that one day, when it's over (weather it went wonderfully or terribly), you dwell on it for months after, not focusing as much on building a marriage!

I don't think it's too late for you to have this outlook. Realize that the wedding is just one FREAKIN day of an entire life. The most important part of the day happened - you married your person. Focus on the now with him, growing as a couple, without your family in your business. Maybe even plan a ""trash the dress"" anniversary photoshoot to re-read your vows somewhere awesome, just the two of you. 

Wishing a happy life to you two!",11594,"Don't get me wrong, I love my husband. I just wish I could have my one day where I felt special and could be the centre of attention. My family had always been abusive and treated me like the dirt under their feet. I guess I should have realized that they would never let me have my perfect day, yet it still freaking hurts to lose a dream you've had since childhood.",11595,"I'm sorry your family has been so horrible. Like most of us with terrible parents, you continue to hope that some day they will become the parents/family you wish for. The only way to heal is to accept what will never happen, grieve for your lost family and build a new one from the people who do truly love you. 

Congratulations on your marriage.",11596,"Okay I can't EXACTLY relate because I am definitely not married, but I will try. During my senior year of high school about three years ago, everyone had grad parties. My friend had one on a day where I was visiting my mom at the nursing home, so I couldn't come. But basically, everyone she invited (people invited like a 100 people to grad parties) had some reason they couldn't come. One friend who went said that all the decorations and all the food were so sad to look at with no one there, no one to use the photo booth, no one to sign her graduation book where you write nice things about your friends.
I always felt sad that I couldn't have a grad party (my mom was really sick) but when I reflected on how it must have felt to seemingly have no one care on your special day, it felt terrible.
But at the end of the day, the day happened for a reason, to commemorate something! You are lucky to have a good relationship w your husband at least :)",11597,"Just reading this made me feel how sad your friend had been on that day. I didn't have a graduation party myself, but I guess having one but having no one coming is a lot more sad.",11598,I'm so sorry. ,11599,"Get a divorce and re marry? 
Just kidding, definitely don't do that. What you can do is make every anniversary special from them on. In a way, it isn't one event that makes your love so special, it is the ongoing events, so try to make that one day a year strictly about you and your husband. Do exactly what you two want to do, and don't let tradition or anything else hold you back.
If you want to stay home and watch Netflix the whole time and just be together, then go ahead! If you want to fly to Venice and take a boat cruise and eat at the fanciest restaurant in Europe, then do that too!
What I am saying is, it sounds like your wedding day was more about family politics than you two, so i wouldent ever let that happen again- push everything/everyone else aside and enjoy yourselves.
😊 ",11600,Everything in my life has been about my family. I've always been pushed to the sidelines and my wedding was no different. I just wanted that one day where the spotlight was on me and didn't get it.,11601,"Yeah that's totally understandable, your family sound like dicks.",11602,"I like this suggestion to make every anniversary special. What if you had an anniversary party next year and invited whomever you felt comfortable inviting? I'm sorry your day was rough, but I hope that you can look forward to the good things to come.",11603,Would it be possible to have a private wedding? With just your friends? Of course not a vow renewal. But just something to wipe away of the bad wedding? ,11604,I hated my wedding as well. My wife and I are planning on a redo. Keep getting married. :)
0,11701,"I was you. Up nights, wishing at every 11:11 that some guy, *any guy*, who's fairly decent would want me. Then I got into a bad relationship, I wanted a guy so badly that I took one who took advantage of me. He kept taking advantage of me because I thought I couldn't get anyone else, it took so long to get him. I finally called it quits, I wasn't going to submit to him any longer. 

Then, when I stopped looking, stopped worrying, my husband found me. We've been together for 5 years this January, married last year. What's funny, he's actually shyer than me. Because of that, I've been forced to be the outgoing one and I have grown so much more than I could have ever expected. I'm still an introvert, and I still prefer books and research to parties, but I no longer fear asking the store associate where their bathroom is, I no longer cringe when I have to call someone who's not a close friend, I no longer get so nervous that I cry when I have to speak in public. 

You will find your guy, just make sure you're not settling for someone because you think they're your only hope. I believe in you. Love yourself, and love will find you. ",11702,"Calling somebody that isn't a friend is a paralyzing fear for me. Often if there's something I want but have to call to schedule it, I'll just convince myself I don't really want it so I don't have to call.",11703,"That's exactly what I used to do!! But my husband was even worse, so now I do all of the calling for the both of us. It takes time and practice, but forcing yourself to make those calls will be so beneficial in the long run! I still run through a script of what I'm going to say before I call someone, that helps tons.",11704,"As another shy girl, I’ve been where you are and I know it feels hopeless. The best thing I did for myself was change perspective and forced myself out of my shell just enough so that I could find the guy I was looking for— I made an online profile that blatantly described the kind of person I am (shy, nerdy, awkward and all). I was frank and unapologetically me because I wanted to attract people who were genuine as well. It helped weed out many people and I ended up being matched with the best person I could have ever hoped for— and I asked them out.

Dating has taught me to learn about myself through the eyes of other people and pick out my own flaws so that I can improve upon them. I chose to make a change, chose to value myself more, and chose to be with a person who makes me want to become the best version of myself. I still struggle with shyness, but I have someone who has seem me beyond that and supports me all the same.

Don’t dwell on the negative future. Focus on the present and take charge of changing your circumstances and make the outcome that you want. It isn’t easy, but it’s definitely possible.",11705,There are guys out there that would chose you. If i found someone that i got along with and was everything you describe about yourself I sure as hell am not going to complain. ,11706,"I think a lot of people (both men and women) will assume (and sometimes rightfully so) that shy people don't want to be in a relationship, because let's face it - some don't. 


I can be fairly shy sometimes and painfully shy when it comes to guys/relationships (so therefore I am not looking) so I always try to shut stuff like that down, but in a light hearted way. But I think if a relationship is what *you* want you may need to come out of your shell a bit more or at least make it known that you are indeed **looking**... Just because you are single, it doesn't always translate to ""single and looking"" no matter what age you are. I hope that helps.",11707,"I'm on the same boat as you. but let me tell you something, If you're in my zone i would definitely date you. YOU'RE PERFECT!",11708,Personally i am outgoing and not shy in anyway. I however prefer shy girls it seems like im always on the go so having someone who wants to stay at home some and just relax is nice. ,11709,"I'm a guy and doing the same as you , meaningless sex for filler. I mean I'm pretty decent at looks and having an adaptive personallity. Some girls are attracted to me but not the kind I'm interested in ( nor looks , nor persoanllity). I'm clinically depressed for 7 years now , feeling lonely , and even unwanted. I had a phase when it crippled me so much that all I ate for 2 months was some rice every day. My most serious relatiion shit was a friends wit benefits that lasted 5 months. I couldnt find anyone matching my interests and stay in a relationship for more than 2 months. Don't get me wrong , My standards are not high for the looks or habbits. 

Picking up some drunk chick isnt a challange , nor is statisfactionary acomplisment. 
I'm not flawless , I made some girls develop a crush on me when I was younger even when I had no intention to deal with them. 
I hardly start to like someone but when I do I can be overly attached witch usually ruins everything. I don't know maybe I'm the one deserving loneliness , not you.",11710,"Its funny, love finds you when you aren't looking for it. I'm in the same place so this hope is all I have",11711,"I met my current introverted, shy girlfriend through an ""ex-girlfriend"" (relationship lasted a week and we were both just bored and looking for a companion). I'm also very shy and introverted and we spend almost every night together in one of our basements watching Netflix (I'm 19, she's 18). We've been together for 2.5 years and I plan on proposing next year. I can't imagine my life without her. 

There's somebody out there for everybody. Don't give up hope :)",11712,"Hey now, there's someone on this huge planet that's right for you.  
I was always hoping for a guy to like me, and to love me for who I was. But since I am fairly introverted, there was no way I was ever going to meet him, or so I thought. However, after a couple years I finally met that guy on Reddit, of all places. He's pretty introverted too, so we match like that.  
I'm sure you'll find your match as well! Love finds its way, if you don't stop looking either!"
0,11732,Are you in therapy? Because your anxiety sounds just as bad as mine was and I needed hella therapy. :(,11733,"No, I was going but I stopped because it was no help. Therapy helps for my depression, somewhat but not for my anxiety. My anxiety stems from nothing in particular, it's just genetic. I went to therapy for years, since I was 8 years old, off and on. I've learned the coping skills, and I've used them, but they do nothing for me when I'm in the situation that's causing me anxiety. ",11735,"Thank you, and yes it does suck. I've had my permit for over 2 years, but I can't bring myself to take the driver's test. Someone will be watching me the whole time and I can't do it.

I do try to drive to get used to it, but it hasn't helped. I've seen therapists in the past and talking about it does nothing for me, although I am on medication for depression and anxiety. Wellbutrin & Klonopin. I'm getting my Klonopin changed to 2x a day pretty soon. ",11739,"Klonopin is actually the only one that works for me so far :( it's perfect for me! I just need to be on it twice a day like I have been before. It took me 3 years to get on the right cocktail of meds. I've been on Prozac, Paxil, Pristique (sp?), Buspar, and Zoloft. and none of them worked. I fought tooth and nail to get on Klonopin and had to switch my doctor on base because she told me ""we may have the wrong diagnosis"" after telling her I wanted Klonopin because it's worked before. Like you can't misdiagnose anxiety when it's so easy for me to see that it's anxiety and I've had it for years. The doctors on base are horrible. ",11740,"

Being a military wife if tough- mostly because you have no control. Not Over your schedules..your time..where you live..etc.

We can all stay sad we’re away from our norm or we can embrace our new surroundings. (I certainly don’t suggest putting in for another base in BFE) but once you guys move, you’ll see there’s so much out there. So much amazing! 
 
I think that you’d be feeling this way regardless of where you were stationed..busy..deserted..you probably would find something to feel upset about-I’m sure it’s just a state of mind exacerbated by the isolation of your current duty station. 

What you need to do is take this year and get yourself on track. Therapy..license...venture out...overcome those fears..live! The military is always a love hate relationship.

I have made some really incredible life long friends through family support groups, volunteer positions and those coffees that are pretty regular.

That might seem like an age you need to have gotten your shit on track by, but truly, there are people in their 30s and 40s living with their parent or parents these days.  Escalating property prices in some cities and the need to care for aging parents make it not only shameless, but if you've vague enough - eg it's best at the moment I'm with my family - you can deflect any embarrassment you feel at being your age and living with your parents.

You may not wish to divorce him but it sounds like you are willing to accept weak and implausible excuses from him, and given your life expectancy is around another five decades, is your husband the man who really deserves to enjoy your youth, beauty, energy, and potential in life when he does not seem to properly appreciate his great fortune in finding such qualities in you?",11823,Who are these girls he's sending these pics to? ,11824,"Random girls on Snapchat.

I am not considering divorce over this. In fact, I would still give my life for his or for any chance at repairing our marriage. I said forever in my vows and I meant it.

If this is a release for him that is between consenting adults that is one issue that could be fairly harmless. If it remains online only with little to no other communication between him and individual women then perhaps a discussion needs to be had on boundaries you need him to abide by.  But if these women are not welcoming his pics then that is a huge red flag in regards to how he treats and views women.

My teeth are pretty sad, but my anxiety usually gets the better of me and I am a notorious worry-wort. 
I think my anxiety has always given me this idea that if I think the absolute worst is going to happen, then I won't be surprised/scared/disappointed at the real outcome of a situation.

But I really don't think that your husband will leave you, or even be upset with you, over your teeth. One, he probably already knows. Two, he just doesn't sound like a shallow or mean person, so he wouldn't do something like that.

As far as a plan of attack goes, a lot of dentists will do payment plans, and I think there are things like care credits that you can use too. A friend of mine had bad teeth too, from a combination of poverty and unlucky genetics, and his wife got them fixed using payment plans and credit options. He ended up just getting dentures, which was less painful for him than having teeth. There are other things like veneers and implants and whatnot; I'm not a dentist so I don't know much about them, but they do exist and there are a lot of options. You might also consider seeing if you have a local dental school. A college roommate of mine had a lot of work done at our school's medical building for very little money. While it is students doing the work, they are supervised by professors so it's really a low-risk proposition.

This is scary, sure, but it's going to be okay. People have this problem, and solve it, all the time. You're not weird or alone or doomed.",12107,"Thank you for your words of reassurance. Once I tell my husband (which I'll do today), I'm sure we'll sit down and figure out a plan, because I want and desperately need to see a dentist asap. I know deep down that he won't leave me, but I've just been freaking out for the past few days and have worked myself up into a panic, which can make me pretty irrational. 
Thank you again for your comforting words, I really need it right now and you just don't know how much I appreciate it. ",12108,"I understand, and can relate somewhat. A little bit of anxiousness can be solved by addressing the source of it, but a perpetual and constant anxiety that makes you believe any action to solve a problem will make it worse is a horrible thing to live with.

From what you tell me, anxiety also is a way your brain has adapted to constantly being disappointed. I'd say with your description of your husband, that adaptation has outlived its usefulness.

If your teeth CAN be saved, it's best to do it early. It sucks that you didn't do it earlier, but that doesn't mean you should give up now. If you don't try to help your teeth, you'll still be 29. You'll just be 29 with bad teeth. 

If he knows you and your anxiety, then he'll understand when you tell him why you put off bringing up the issue. It feels like the bottom will fall out, but I believe you'll find that trying to help your teeth with your husband by your side will be preferable to the perpetual worry you feel in the status quo. 

Do you feel like you know the best way to approach him about it?",12109,"He definitely does know my anxiety, and I know he'll understand. 

Right now my plan is to write out what I want to say to him, and try my best to verbalize it to him once he gets home. If I start crying and can't finish telling him, I'll just let him read what I've written down. 
After than, I'm sure, he'll comfort me and we'll sit down and figure out a plan. 
I've been worrying about this for days and have just whipped myself up into such a panic that I'm not thinking rationally. ",12110,"The longer you wait, the worse it will get.

I had to put off all dental work for a few years (had literally no money for it) and my teeth/gums have never recovered. My husband was terrified of the dentist.  Didn't take care of his teeth. And by the time that he finally did (because the pain was so bad) he lost them all. (He was ~30)

But don't let that scare you! Even if that's the worse thing that can happen (losing your teeth) it happens to people every day. Sometimes for reasons they can't control (like injuries/accidents). You can still regain a beautiful smile. You are worthy of love. And everything can be okay.

Find a dentist you feel comfortable with. Let them know you are afraid (they have heard it all before. They should be able to put you at ease. If you don't like them, go somewhere else.)",12111,"That does scare me, but I'm truly hoping I'm not too late in saving them. I know of a few dentists that I think I would be okay with, I even have a friend who's a dentist, but, sadly, he only does extractions (that's weird, right?).
I'll likely give them a call once I tell my husband. I'm still just terrified at the thought of the entire situation though. 
",12113,"Thank you, I absolutely need a hug right now. 

Right now I'm praying that one of the two dentists I'm hoping to see will let me do a payment plan. However, I might PM you soon and ask you some of the details about your trips to Mexico. 
Thank you for your kind words.",12114,"I'm sorry that you are experiencing this. My boyfriend has had similar problems and from what you're saying, your husband most likely already knows and doesn't want to pressure you into doing anything if you are uncomfortable with it. My boyfriend's teeth cracked while he was just sitting there playing games like 4 years ago. There are times I try to help him get back on track with brushing and stuff but he often forgets. He doesn't like to floss unless they're the floss picks and he brushes way too hard when he does. I tried teaching him how to floss when we first started dating but it didn't go very well ahah I know he is afraid to go to the dentist because he hasn't gone in years and I can see his teeth slowly getting worse. I am hoping I can convince him to get his teeth cleaned with me some day. His mom has even spoken to me about it and told me that she would cover the costs of it. Get a very soft toothbrush to start and sensitive toothpaste. Keep your mouth closed and do not brush in front of the mirror. Invest in better floss too. Costco sells a large pack of [6](http://www.harveycares.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/Glide-Pro-Health-Protection-Floss.jpg). They glide easily into your gum and don't really tear. Also buy a non alcohol mouthwash, I use Listerine Total Care Zero,the purple one. Use it every morning and night. It is best to start now than later. Do everything at the kitchen sink with no mirror. It will lessen your anxiety. I'm lucky to live in Canada where I was covered until I was 18 and I also had braces after that which made me take care of my teeth even more. I get coverage under my college health plan for cleanings but I know how expensive it is without. I don't know if it's genetics or what but honestly, I used to be pretty bad with my dental care. I ate A LOT of candy as a kid, drank tons of sugary drinks and forgot to brush a lot of nights due to just falling asleep and I never flossed until I was in high school but I've never had a cavity before. The dental hygienists are always surprised too. You would be surprised how your teeth will change in just a week of taking care of them more. Once you find the courage to tell your husband, ask him to come with you. It can be scary being alone in the dentist chair and every dentist has seen all types of teeth. They are there to do their job and that is to give you a better confident smile and I hope you can smile one day for your husband too. Also, I would invest in a good electronic toothbrush when you can afford it and when you aren't as afraid to brush your teeth, my teeth were at its best when I was using one but unfortunately I don't have it anymore and I can tell it made a huge difference. They go on huge sales around black Friday.",12115,"Thank you so very much for the advice. I truly appreciate it. I'm terrified to start this journey to regain my smile, but I'm ready. ",12117,"I was in a similar situation a few years ago. I found a dental assistant school that needed patients for students to practice cleanings on. It took a bit longer, but they explained what they were doing. They also x rayed them, so I knew what other problems needed to be dealt with. Mine weren't as bad as I'd feared, only one major issue and some cavities. It was well worth it!"

He downloaded it. ",12159,"Rape is a common fantasy among men and women. I knew a couple who regularly acted it out. Didn't make him a rapist no more than it made her someone who ""deserved to be raped"" or ""was asking for it"". 

Would you be concerned if you found a game simulating generic, missionary sex where one or both parties involved don't get off? Or where one person guilt's the other into having sex that night? Or where one person asks frequently for sex, only to be denied? 

Sex is weird. Fantasies are weird. Porn is WEIRD imo. If he's not otherwise violent or aggressive, I would pass this off as a weird fetish or phase. Maybe a coping mechanism to deal with how powerless he feels going through the divorce?

Usually when I’m really concerned about something, I stay weary. I’d say to keep an eye out for any new behaviors in this realm of topics.

While yes, people have rape fantasies and this is just a game, the fact that you are worried and that he lied is a bit concerning. I wouldn’t freak out, this could really all be nothing. If this kind of thing keeps happening and is continuously making you feel worse, though, I’d do something about it.

As for you being in immediate danger, I doubt that. I’m sorry that you used to get coerced into sex. I’m sure that is contributing to your unease. Hang in there and be safe.

What you’re describing is what I’m trying to deal with right now.  He genuinely seemed to love me. And yet he had been cheating on me throughout the marriage. I can’t reconcile those two statements. I can’t imagine how someone can do that and still live with himself. Pathological liar—he was and still is, which makes the process of the divorce harder still. I have to go to the city where he still lives next week on business, and have an irrational fear that I’ll bump into him there. It is an “instinctual fear”. I hadn’t really realized that.

0,12246,"I actually laughed a little bit. Yes, it was mean and spiteful, but you didn't do it to hurt his wife but as a way to get back at him for abusing you, which is understandable. And from his reaction looks like it worked.

By saying what you did, you have probably made sure that he is going to stay away from you for the foreseeable future, which is a huge win. There is no upside to having him be a part of your life.

It's understandable that you feel bad about your comment, but his wife probably didn't even hear it, and in any case you're not making anything better by reaching out to either of them.

You are YOU. That's allowed! Not everyone WANTS the girl next door type. Or the manic pixie dream girl.

I know my husband would like me to be a little less...this way...but obviously he knew what he was getting into when he married me.,12364,"goddd literally SAME. 

&#x200B;

I want to be carefree and fun and outdoorsy but i hate bugs and being dirty and uncomfortable. My friends think I'm a prude because I have to put on my makeup and do my hair even if we're going out to brunch but they really don't understand why I feel like I have to. Even I don't understand why I have to! I just do! I just got back from a vacation and my idea of a vacay is clearly in a separate universe from most peoples idea of one. I just wanted to lay by the beach, sleep in, go out to eat and maybe do shopping then be in bed by 9:00pm. But instead I spent my whole vacation waking up at 7:00am and walking literally 15 miles a day in the fucking summer heat because that's what everyone else wanted to do.  They would even park miles away from our destination ON PURPOSE JUST SO WE COULD WALK MORE.  I felt like the wet blanket of the trip because I was miserable....and it's hard for me to not let everyone know how miserable I am.  But that's what I get for having friends who are the ""carefree up for anything type"". 

&#x200B;

I find it's hard to be okay with who I am , like I'm constantly trying to be someone that I'm just *not.* Accepting ourselves is one of the hardest things there is and there's no right or wrong way to do it, it's just something that has to happen I guess. There's always going to be that person who says ""if you don't like something about yourself then just C H A N G E  I T"". Clearly those people have never cried because they spent an hour meticulously curling their hair but then had to end up HIKING UP A HUGE ASS HILL IN THE RAIN TO GET TO A PARTY THAT I DIDN'T EVEN WANT TO GO TO IN THE FIRST PLACE....yeah still bitter about that. I can't change who I am and I am just not the girl I wish I could be. But I'm funny and I work hard and I treat people well and I care about people! In the grand scheme of things what matters most? Being true to ourselves or being true to the person who we hope to someday maybe be? imo that sounds like a lot of waiting around because  if I spend my life comparing who I am to who I want to be then I'll spend my life letting myself down.

&#x200B;

I guess what I'm trying to say is you're not alone! There are plenty of people like you and me and we are not any less fun than someone who is a spontaneous sky diving world travelling no makeup wild spirit. We're just probably not their idea of fun and I'm okay with that if it means I don't have to wake up at 5am on my day off to hike a mountain.

&#x200B;

you sound like an awesome person and your husband definitely knows that. 

&#x200B;",12365,"Ha, thank you!  You too!  You sound so much like me, minus the hair curling (mine doesn't really hold style, but I do it for special events lol).  It can be really annoying when you're told to accept yourself, but then everyone complains about the way you just...are.  You sound funny and fun to be around!",12366,Also wanted to say I love your username lol,12367,hahaha thank you but I think yours wins omg! I feel like we would be really great friends!,12368,Have you ever thought that maybe in your husbands romantic comedy that you’re the amazing carefree girl that he saw? He married you because he loves you!,12369,Aww well thank you! I know he would prefer me to be more carefree ,12370,"I feel like those carefree people you compare yourself to are aliens because I relate to you much more lol. I sweat way too easily and my mood just completely crashes when my feet ache or I feel unclean. 

But also remember that you don’t see everything about those people and I’m sure they have plenty of “flaws” just like you think have yours. Pretty much everyone picks out things they don’t like about themselves and thinks all their other friends are perfect. I’m sure your friends also wish they were more like you. Besides, I know tons of guys who don’t like sports or the outdoors that much, and honestly thinking that all guys like the same thing is just negative stereotyping. 

I personally admire you a lot for putting so much care into your makeup and looks. I don’t have much talent or willpower for it. There’s nothing wrong with taking the time to present yourself the way that makes you feel best. I feel like brunch is a totally appropriate occasion for makeup. I get super shy about wearing sweats to the grocery store so I usually dress up a bit more. Better overdressed to impress than underdressed, right? 

I’m sure your husband knows you well enough and chose you because he loves you. No need to worry about preferences, and if it comes down to it there’s nothing bad about compromising and having a bit of both kinds of dates. ",12371,"I assure you there are legions of men who will want to do exactly what you want, honestly.

You just have to look for them, and, most importantly, BE HONEST.

He/she will always be apart of both your lives and you will grow knowing you did everything you could and it's no one's fault. It just  honestly isnt.

I remember the nurse coming in and telling my wife who was hysterical at the time this one thing before we left and it didn't help at the time but looking back it wasn't for that time. The nurse knew nothing can be said or done to ever help you, us or anyone else in this moment you feel right now, but she said it and it was like a timebomb going off at the right time and moment in our lives down the road.

""From the moment you concieved your baby it started forming its own DNA, and as your body changes back to being you, there will always remain a trace of the babies altered DNA in your body. You will always carry apart of him/her for the rest of your life""

But you are not alone. It is very common (1 in 3) for first pregnancies to result in a loss. I lost my first pregnancy February of 2015. July of 2016 I had a healthy baby boy.

It’s not like I get new parents.  

He never said a thing about her, as in nothing unpleasant,  paid child support, etc.  She even refused to return a  cordial “hello” from him at my wedding!

My ex talks bad about me, including exaggerated and even wildly untrue things.  To my daughter an family, friends, his work, etc.  I never said anything to him although I thought we should keep our child out of it.  I said her job was to be a kid and go to school.  Period.  That fell on deaf ears, but I didn’t get into defending myself. He was embarrassed I left him, shocked, I think.

It sounds like you’ve had doubts for awhile...and he lied?  I hope you are protecting yourself from STDs, seriously.  Please get tested,

What happens next?  Here to listen if you want.  I’m guessing you’ve spoken about it.  Regardless, it may be time to talk to an attorney.  And a marriage counselor if you two want to stay together.  I’d still talk to the attorney and not tell him.  Don’t l him talk you into a private divorce mediation if there are assets.  ",12453,I'm so sorry this happened to you. This is truly devistating.

I resent my mother so much for staying in an unhappy marriage which has affected both my sister and my ability to be in happy romantic relationships. 

The model of love you're showing them is flawed and doing lasting damage to them. Ideally, children should have two parents who love each other as role models. Parents staying together and resenting each other is no substitute for this. They'll be better knowing that when a partner is not upholding their vows, you have to have self respect enough leave.

I agree with you and had nothing to add to the subject, so I just left the comment in case original poster replies so I can catch up with the story and maybe give my insight or advice.",12460,Omg sorry I thought OP posted that 😂😂😂 I'm a dumbass ,12461,"Hehe, it happens :)"
0,12499,"As someone who has made a similar but not identical mistake, you have to be the one to forgive yourself. We all make mistakes and we all have set backs. Both you and I are lucky to have someone who gave us a second chance. 

Unpopular, but this is why I do not believe that once a cheater, always a cheater. Everyone fucks up in one way or another in life. The difference in my opinion is learning from said mistakes and committing to some self love and some soul searching. In my situation, my actions ended up being a result of my own fears ad insecurities about my relationship. I didn't physically cheat but I have been able to identify and face these issues head on because of that mistake. It also proved to me how important and loved I am by my ever so forgiving and understanding s.o.

The past is the past. You're human, shit happens, and it's okay to let yourself be happy!  You did everything right after that night. You were honest with him and you told him how you felt. Most people don't even get that far!",12500,"That was a good post - I agree that to be human is to screw up. You need to learn from your mistakes and learn to forgive yourself.

Good luck",12501,Thank you ,12502,"As someone who has been cheated on 7 times, I seriously hate people like you. I never ever give 2nd chances. Trust is ruined forever.

You probably also shouldn’t be drinking alcohol around other guys at this point.

Yes you fucked up but it was a one time fuck up, and you were honest with your partner.

Almost exact scenario. 
It took 10 years, but I finally saw one day:

You can't take it back. You can't undo it. There is no point in dwelling. Your SO took you back, and you are happy. Focus on THAT. Focus on making him happy. 

I could understand your stressing if you never told your husband about it, but you did. And that's the big important thing. He knows what happened. It was all out on the table. He forgave you, and he moved on. 

You'll be afraid and look for that dude EVERYWHERE. Which is why you'll see him everywhere. You just have to try to let it go.

In my case. I talked to my bf. Then i went and talked to the guy. Got it all sorted. It was awkward. But it's done. I still don't talk to the dude to this day, but there are no more hard feelings. 

All you can do is move forward with the solemn vow to NEVER. DO IT. AGAIN. The rest takes care of itself. :) ",12505,You don't deserve him. ,12506,Maybe not. But I'll try my best to prove otherwise. It's been going good for the last 4 years...hoping for another 40 at least :) ,12507,"Good enough to cheat on him, who is to say it wont happen again sometime in the next 40 years? 

Good on him for forgiving you and trying to push through, but he shouldn't have too, that's the point of a loving, trusting relationship. ",12508,"Why are you being so negative for no reason? Jfc she clearly is struggling with it, no need to kick someone while they’re down. Take your projections somewhere else. ",12509,"For the simple reason that OP has come to the internet for empathy for a fucked up thing she did. Almost all replys are in the context of "" awww babe, chin up, we all make mistakes""... Yes we do, but we don't go to strangers to try and make us feel better about it. We go to the person we hurt and souly the person we hurt and try fix it and work on it and work on it and work on it and work on it, and truth be told.. OP will probably always feel like crap for what she has done, and rightfully so.

I'm not projecting, I stating that out of all human betrayals this is right up the top. ",12510,She clearly had been working on it with her SO so I’m not sure why your complaining about that. She just also feels regret and is looking for some support which doesn’t hurt anyone. 
0,12575,"I have actually noticed this too but was afraid to mention it. Actually kinda nervous of the potential backlash from this comment. I have seen lots of women use their infertility as a justification for being rude. I can imagine that the women who struggle with these issues but put on their brave faces and are supportive and kind to the women who easily get pregnant despite the envy might even find it more upsetting than you or I as they know how upsetting it is but still are kind to people. I mean, you don't have to be excited or even supportive when other people are pregnant. You can distance yourself as much as you want and need; you're not obligated to celebrate anybody else's pregnancy. But it just isn't okay to be angry and rude to people because you are having trouble getting pregnant. I agree. And it's ridiculous to tell somebody they love their child less for not showering them with gifts every year. ",12576,"Eh, fuck people. People are jealous. It happens. Jealousy often leads to being rude, and sometimes for good reason. But any situation like these are simply self-absorbed. ",12577,"I think it's pretty cool that you do that with your daughter for her birthday, but if I was in your shoes or any of your friends' shoes and someone said something stupid like that to me I would've been crowned biggest asshole of the year. I have a tendency to say really mean things when provoked.",12578,Thanks! My daughter seems to love her birthdays and cool username! ,12579,"...>.>
<.<....
From the rest of the comments I'm a little scared to admit I'm a fellow infertile. (I always imagine a giant red stamp sitting in some doctor's office waiting to be smashed onto my forehead when I pull out that word.)

1. Yup, jealous people, sad people, angry people, and bitter people all have some pretty weird ways of justifying their jealousy, sadness, anger, and bitterness. Doesn't make it right, but it does mean that that's how they're feeling. 
2. I love how you celebrate your daughter's birthday and it's exactly how my husband and I have always dreamed of celebrating our imaginary 8 kids birthdays, Christmases, and general other gift giving holidays like Easter, etc. Endless toys? No thank you. Teaching generosity and interpersonal relationships? Yes please. 
3. I definitely felt some lows during this two year journey, especially in the first six months. I tried my hardest to never take it out on others who may not want children, may have had or will have abortions in their lifetime, hate/don't want adoption, any woman suffering from miscarriages, etc. I guess it's not a pass for bad behavior, but I will say infertility is some of the hardest feelings I've ever experienced (coming from someone who endured every type of abuse as a child). It's not just wanting children, but wanting to be part of a community of mothers, wanting to love someone and be loved by someone unconditionally, wanting to mold little minds, wanting to make your wonderful partner a parent, wanting to have a big family and share meals together and share lives together. It's a lot of different things to a lot of different people and it really super duper sucks when the choice of having that is taken away from you. 

I hate that some women lash out in their anger and hurt over it, but I try to give them grace because it really can destroy lives and relationships and hope. Before it happened to me I never fully grasped how much it hurts, and isn't that always how suffering goes?",12580,"No reason to be afraid and thank you so much for your insight! I too was abused as a child, but I really have no clue how I would feel not being able to have children. Even for somebody who never wants children I feel that must be really hard. Though I can't really understand it, I do try to empathize. I understand being upset at certain things. For example, there have been times that I've been annoyed because my baby was keeping me up; though it's totally normal to be frustrated with getting no sleep I do think we often take our babies for granted. And in circumstances like that I could see being frustrated when it seems a parent doesn't appreciate something you want so badly. But I feel a lot of women are really letting it get out of hand and it just isn't okay to torment somebody else out of envy. 

Interestingly though, my sister in law was telling me that that particular woman has always been an attention seeker. So, it kinda seems more like she's just, well a jerk and found an ""excuse"" to be a jerk.",12581,"I definitely understand. Honestly I'm so glad that you can't fully relate to that particular issue (and am very sorry to hear you can relate to the abuse.) Obviously you're trying to empathize as well as you can and that's something that the women you've dealt with recently have failed to do for you. Just wanted to throw my two cents in as ""the struggle is real"", so to speak, and I know I would definitely appreciate the grace others give me in my worst moments, whether I deserve it or not. I hope your interactions with her in the future, if necessary, are more positive and she realizes how to treat others she disagrees with. You seem to be doing a wonderful job as a mom and more power to you with those birthdays! :)",12582,"That woman is a total psycho. I think it's far more likely her children will hate *her* than that yours will hate you, because she's inevitably going to treat them like this as well. This is a total aside from the point of your post, I realize, but I guess my message here is - that woman is crazy, and she is probably crazy in far more than one aspect of her life. She just chose to unleash the crazy on you around the bday party issue.

all that said - yes, it is infuriating that people do this, and no, infertility is not an OK reason to treat other people like crap. Just as Roman Polanski doesn't get a pass for raping a little girl because he's had other tragedies in his life, neither do people get a free pass to crap on others because of infertility.",12583,"It may just be gossip, but my sister in law told me that the woman has always been an attention seeker. They went to high school together and she told me that the woman always thought she was sick and was always at the hospital for something. Now, she seems to think her child has every illness known to man. It seems she's just starved for attention and her struggling to get pregnant gave her a pass for it. ",12584,"oh, I can believe that 100%. That's a pretty huge fit she threw in public over something reeeeeeally small, which was also none of her business.",12585,"I find it ironic that my daughter is supposedly going to hate me for not throwing her birthday parties, yet, she interrupted a fun moment that her kid was having swimming with her father and the other kids just because she had a temper tantrum. ",12586,"I really *really* hope you didn't take this woman's words to heart. Seriously, she is nuts. Would you *ever* start berating an acquaintance like that over how they chose to celebrate a birthday? totally, totally insane."
