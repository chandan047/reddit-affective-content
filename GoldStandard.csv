14148,"As I person who comes from a split family, parents divorced when I was 3, I'm 22 now. I ended up living with and being raised by my maternal grandparents. They took the approach as op, never did they lay a finger on me, other than a gentle slap on the shoulder or leg if I was back talking, even then that was followed by a long talk on why what I did was wrong. 

As someone who is in college for psychology I now fully understand the benefits of that form of discipline, it teaches the child morals and not fear. ",[3],[2]
14154,"Both of my parents were unfit, so Im afraid Id be a mixture which is even worse. ",[2],[]
14147,"I believe in this type of parenting 100%. You're a great dad, and your son will be a wonderful person as a result of the attention and discipline he received as a child.",[2],[2]
14153,"It was one of my biggest fears growing up. I have cousins who have shrugged and tell me 'Dad also did it, that's how it is' But no, it doesn't have to be that way.",[3],[2]
14151,"My father died, but same. I wanna cry happy tears over this post, however. Its beautiful to seen traumatized children turn into stellar parents. Personally I'm afraid to ever have children because I don't have an example set for ""good parenting"".",[2],[3]
14152,"Same here, I mean I think I'm afraid I would be like my father tho!",[2],[2]
14144,Thank you for being a great dad!  It will mean the world to your child and he will always know he is loved no matter what life throws at him.  Great job!,[1],[3]
14146,Thanks. I've taken a sort of tough love approach when it comes to discipline. My wife took some classes in college that involved child development and I took some of the stuff she would talk to me about and incorporate it into my methods. The most important thing I took out of it is that a kid has to learn he is being punished for what he did and that the punishment is not a reaction from the parents anger.,[3],[3]
14150,"You almost made me cry, saddly I didn't have that kind of relationship with my father and he abandoned us some years ago",[3],[3]

Thanks, that made me laugh.",[1],[2]
12735,"I am mad at myself for looking. I am mad that I had a reason to look.

The problem is it isn't some random guy. I have already seen him twice last month and will see him again this weekend. My wife is in a choir with him and the choir meets every week and my wife normally goes out for drinks afterwards. We have kids so I don't go to a quarter of the outings. I was at a whiskey tasting party this past Saturday and it was awkward for me. We were playing a board game and sexual innuendos were everywhere. Also since we have kids I had to go home early to relieve the babysitter.

Fuck we organized a Mardi Gras trip with an airbnb place booked and he will be there. We will be carpooling for hours..",[3],[3]
12728,I don't know why she thinks this other guy is a nice guy. He seems like a total douche for flirting with a married person in secret,[1],[2]
12731,"I know it sounds weird, but in his defense she started it.",[1],[2]
12740,It would not be helpful messaging her friends as I doubt they would appreciate being brought into this drama and would just make everyone feel uncomfortable. Better for her to just quit the choir if you are going to go nuclear.,[1],[2]
12738,"It's not your fault, has nothing to do with you! Other than your wife crossed a line that shouldn't of been crossed. & for her to want to continue to be friends with him ""after some distance"" sounds odd. 

If I were your wife and did that. I'd cut all contact to show you, and regain your trust. 


Seems all a little weird.

You have every right to be any emotion you please! For god sakes it's you're wife. You may want to copy and paste this to r/marriage. They're extremely helpful over there. ",[1],[3]
12739,She told me she was a little worried to cut all contact as they have a close group of friends and was worried about gossip. I told her then she is lucky I found the messages as my first thought was to messages her friends for answers. I might still do it.,[2],[2]
12729,"Yeah, but she's at least as much or more of a douche. She can't acknowledge the other guy's douchiness without simultaneously admitting her own.",[1],[2]
12736,"Your wife has a crush on him, it happens. What shouldn't be happening is your wife allowing herself to act on that crush. She really needs to put some distance between herself and that guy. That means no social interations, especially where alcohol is involved, as she has shown herself to be willing to engage in behaviours that are detrimental to your marriage.",[1],[3]
12732,"but he let it continue, knowing she is married to you. they are both at fault. i'm sorry you're going through this OP",[1],[2]
5759,"I read a piece recently that I think you'll appreciate: [The Sorrow and the Shame of the Accidental Killer](https://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2017/09/18/the-sorrow-and-the-shame-of-the-accidental-killer). The writer covers the story of Maryann Gray, who hit a young boy who ran out in front of her car when she was 22 and would be pronounced dead upon arrival at the hospital, how it affected her life, and more broadly, what people like Gray and you deal with.

Hopefully this article, and the organization the article mentions - [Accidental Impacts](http://accidentalimpacts.org/) - can provide you with some psychological comfort. From their homepage:

> We are good people who have unintentionally harmed others, in accidents occurring on the roads, at work, at play, or around the home. I call us CADIs (Causing Accidental Death or Injury). Most of us feel grief, guilt, and distress about our accidents. Over time, we learn that our mistake does not have to define us.

5760,I want to thank you from the bottom of my heart for this comment. I spent hours last night on the website reading stories. It was honestly healing. Thank you so very much.,[1],[3]
5762,I was trying to remember this person. Im glad you posted this. I hope connecting with others helps op to heal,[1],[2]
5768,Maybe your mom and OP can talk?,[1],[1]
5769,My mom is tech illiterate and tech phobic and would probably be pissed  that I'm sharing her story on the Intercloud  for Goggle coins and perverts to read.,[2],[1]
5761,Puts a smile on my face to hear that it helped. It's always the little things :),[1],[3]
5765,Thank you so much. Thats a beautiful way to do something positive. Thank you for that perspective.,[1],[2]
5767,"Thank you. She's made peace with it for the most part. It's just really hard when the big holidays roll around and his family puts up memorials at that corner. Brings up a lot of emotion for her. But she is a decent woman and volunteers and works hard to contribute to society. My brother rides motorcycles too... around the same age as the guy she hit. That bothers me a lot some nights.  Good people, bad people, doesn't matter. Death comes to us all. ",[3],[3]
5764,"Thats very inspiring. I believe life is about perspective. This is great advice for healing purposes.

8461,"I am so sorry for their loss. I don't know how close you are with your neighbor, but small acts of kindness do not go unnoticed in hard times. If you have a chance, check in and ask them how they are doing. Loss and grief can lead to serious isolation, or at least the feeling of isolation. I hope your neighbors are getting the support they need, and that they find their way through the fog of grief. ",[1],[3]
8463,I don't want to be insensitive but I'd like to ask how did you lose your child?,[1],[2]
8459,I love this. You have amazing parents!!,[1],[3]
8466,"Thank you. It's every parents biggest fear. I had trouble sleeping for a long time, and now with my 5 month old I still wake up in a panic sometimes. The loss has definitely left some scars.",[3],[3]
8457,This is beautiful and you have amazing parents.,[1],[2]
8467,This post gives me hope for humanity. Utterly beautiful.,[1],[3]
8460,"Was just informed that a neighbor lost their 8 year old daughter to a rare form of cancer this morning. They knew it was coming soon, yet it still hit like a ton of bricks. I cannot even fathom the loss you guys have experienced and hope I never have to. Thanks for sharing this message of hope for a brighter future. ",[3],[3]
8458,What a beautiful family.,[1],[2]
13304,"I agree, at a minimum you should tell him so that if your stalker ever comes back, it won't be you alone this time. That is some terrifying stuff you have had to live through and I really hope this guy doesn't ever do that again to you or anyone else!",[1],[2]
13313,"If not, my recommendation would be to keep your eyes peeled and get photo or video.. Obviously not as easy as it sounds.. ",[1],[2]
13308,"My point is, I don't think they COULD issue a restraining order. The texts/calls that came from his number did stop. He has plausible deniability that some other random person was calling me from the office/store numbers. He has not contacted me in any way I can actually link back to him in more than 2.5 years. How can I trace that it was him who tapped something to a bus shelter 3 years ago? or wrote messages in snow, or spray painted a sign 3 years ago? I have no PROOF that it was him. They don't hand out ROs like candy, at least not in Canada.",[3],[3]
13306,"Since its so low key now what would I even say. Yeah I'm getting these voicemails of breathing and kissy noises a few times a month from random numbers, and I think its this guy who stalked me 3 years ago but I can't prove anything. Yeah, if he starts stalking me again in person then I can video him and have proof. At this point its just he said, she said. I mean yes, I have texts telling him to desist contacting me saved on my phone, but because he stopped using his own number it looks like he complied. I basically have NOTHING.",[3],[2]
13311,"So there's my point.. If that's the info you got that easily, I'm sure law enforcement could get a lot more info a lot faster.. What's the worst that happens? They say, sorry ma'am there's nothing were can do, but if anything else happens please call us right away... Then at least there's a record of it.. ",[1],[2]
13305,"This sounds like a WP, but it's not.. I'd say police are the way to go.. Communications with your husband are key too, providing you trust him to trust your judgement in not telling him until now.. 

If he's the type that would feel 'betrayed' by you 'hiding' this for so long, it may not be the best idea. ",[1],[2]
13307,"Well, a couple things here... You have his phone number, whether or not it's still valid is irrelevant.. So long as it was a fixed billable line, they'll be able to track down his info.. At the very least, you could issue a restraining order, thereby sending him straight to jail if he breaches it. Also, this gives the police a record of what's happened, just in case it does escalate in the future.. Cops don't take stalkers lightly.. You dont sound crazy.. Cops have to deal with lunatics and paranoid people all day.. I assure you they've heard crazier stories and worked with much less information.. ",[1],[2]
13310,"Yes, Even I was able to get his full name and address from his phone number as he called me from a landline. He deleted his facebook which I used to confirm his ID and I can't find any other presence of him online, or couldn't last I looked.",[2],[1]
13312,"You have a lot of information here. More than most people.
That creep is still making you behave differently, so he continues to control you, whether you see this, or not.
Please tell your husband, and the police. He could easily be trapped by you calling the number, with police present. Please stop letting him rule your life! He is a cruel man who has preyed on your sensitive nature. His behaviour suggests that he could be dangerous. Please report him before he damages someone more than he already damaged you!",[1],[3]
13309,"hmmm... you make a good point.. I still think talking to the police can't hurt.. They may say, we'll take a look at what you have and try to find out who it is.. For all you know, there's all sorts of evidence linking him to you via his personal paper trail.. Once the cops know who he is, they can do their own investigating.. That is if they decide they actually want to do a bit of work.. lol",[1],[2]
9321,"Are you (or him) military? Just the way you called him a Sergeant with no other context makes it seem that way, in which case I'm sure his commander would LOVE to hear about the way one of their NCOs is behaving off-duty.

",[1],[2]
9317,Even if he is a seargent go to the police station and tell em and show em the proof,[1],[2]
9327,"Go to the police with the pictures, and names of witnesses. That's absolutely not alright. ",[1],[3]
9328,"I remember something similar to this happened to me from a complete stranger at target once. It was the most terrifying, disgusting feeling and I'm so sorry this has happened to you, OP. Please tell a family member, friend, ANYONE, to help you report him and offer you support if your husband won't. This isn't okay. ",[2],[3]
9319,"If he's a sergeant I bet his superiors would LOVE to see how he conducts himself off-duty.

Crucify his ass. ",[1],[2]
9324,Op please inform the police,[1],[2]
9325,"Report him to his superiors. If he is doing it to you off duty he may be doing it on duty.

Im so sorry you had to go through that. ",[1],[2]
9326,"Report that sick fuck to the watch commander at his police department.


If he's so nonchalant about doing this shit to you at a party filled with people watching, imagine what he does to other people when no one watches. Or what he does behind the badge.",[1],[3]
9318,She also could have meant seargent in the military?,[1],[1]
9323,Wow I'm so so sorry that happened to you and please tell your husband (if he doesn't know) because if I were him that guy would either be in court or with a Knife in is heart.it makes me angry that this happened to you.fuck I hate those people who do things like that god I'm actually triggered (I did see the warning ),[1],[3]
9383,"As someone who was raised by a mom in a similar situation as yours, please don't take it out on your daughter. Don't neglect her. She's just a kid, love her as much as you can.

Most of my emotional problems and lack of confidence come directly from how my mom raised me. I'm sorry about your situation but please please don't take it out on your child.",[3],[2]
9374,Hello and sorry for what you're going through. Isn't your child a citizen of that country? I think you might get a residency permit if you're the mother of a citizen. Do you know if it's possible?,[1],[2]
9372,"Honestly from the sound of things it doesn't seem like a daycare will be a fix all solution.  If this is how your husband treats you that's kind of a red flag.  I'd personally say going back home would be good for you.

Edit: Also possibly counseling could be an option perhaps?",[1],[2]
9371,"I have. So many times. And he either changes for a little while then goes back, or basically belittles my feelings. At this point, the marriage is over. I'm just at the point where I am waiting for news about daycare, because that will be the difference between staying here and having to go back home. I will need a working visa to stay here, as my spousal visa will be null once we get a divorce, and I can't work if I don't have childcare.",[3],[2]
9376,"If you are staying home and not working then you guys need to share your finances. His money needs to be your money, end of story. You should not be asking for money. You guys need to sit down and discuss this and come to agreements about what is acceptable spending and determine a budget. Your relationship will continue to deteriorate if you guys cant do this. 

Seriously, get your name on that bank account ASAP.",[1],[3]
9375,It should in theory be possible but even if he pays child support it won't be enough to live on if I can't work full-time.,[2],[1]
9379,Sounds like you need some help. Resenting your child is never a good thing. Obviously your husband is not in it 50/50 with you and that needs to change or you need to leave. Sounds like youre having a rough time. Hope you can get the help you need (and kick your husband in the ass!).,[1],[2]
9378,"Thank you for you story, advice, and kind words. ",[1],[2]
9382,Thank you so much for your kind words.,[1],[2]
9373,"Yes, if I want to stay here I will need the work (which means I need childcare) but I think the real problem is the unsupportive husband. He thinks counseling is a waste of money just like the meds/therapy I was getting for depression so I think he isn't interested in working it out.",[3],[]
5595,"1. Im so sorry this happened to you OP. 
2. I would purge everything that belonged to him and her and just cast it out of your life. 
3. You dont HAVE to be around for the holidays. Honestly, you shouldnt be around a situation that toxic.  I recommend going to a therapist and getting this frustration out. Hit up a gym and work out to get all the tension out. 

This is a time to be kind to yourself and not beat yourself up. Reject those two from your life and if you choose to forgive , do it for the sake of your own mental health. 

But fuck them, theyre awful. Move on to other things. Better things. When you show them you dont dwell on their shitty personalities, theyll see they fucked up. Plus Karma will get them soon. ",[1],[2]
5602,"Do NOT remain involved in their lives. Their level of betrayal is absolutely heinous. Dont play happy little Aunt for holidays. Let them explain why youre absent from family events. You did nothing wrong here. They each made a choice, and not once did they care about your feelings. Time to live your best life. ",[1],[2]
5599,"Everything Delta said, but also I would definitely not go to anything during the holidays where they will also be. If your parents and the rest of your family aren't willing to back you up on this (in terms of making sure you'll feel comfortable being there), they have no right to complain if you don't go to them for Christmas or whatever. Book yourself a nice holiday instead, or go see friends, and if you still do want to see your parents, go another time before or after the holidays.",[1],[2]
5601,"God damned right. I used to do this when things with the family were just not going to be ok...You are never obligated to subject yourself to horseshit ""because it's the holidays"" Go do something for YOU.",[2],[2]
5604,"I think you don't have to torture yourself remembering everything, it's a 20/20 hindsight situation, you obviously can tell he was lying now but I think you did the right thing trusting your partner, even if it backfired, he is in the wrong not you. 
I also think you should skip thanksgiving and stuff you know they will attend for a while since it'll be hard to watch and not good for you at all. Just spend it with a friend or don't do anything at all, who cares about holidays anyways? 
Feel free to pm me if you need to vent. Stay strong, you are better on your own!",[1],[2]
5603,Thats the attitude to have!!,[1],[1]
5598,"This this this this THIS.

Be glad you found this out now, before you had kids together.

You have my respect for handling this probably a lot better than I would; do what I did when my now ex-fiancee cheated on me earlier this year. Cut them out, work on yourself for a while, don't look back.",[3],[2]
5597,"You also dodged a bullet, in a way. You have no children with him, so you are not tied to him for the rest of your life. You can cut them off clean, and do separate things with your family. You can go completely no contact with your sister and your ex husband, if you choose. You can be happy. You will be happy. ",[1],[]
5596,"You know what? Youre absolutely fucking right. The only way Ill get over this (at all) is if I pick myself up and become happy without them. Theyre the ones who fucked up so I dont deserve to beat myself up over it forever.  I know its going to be hard, but youre right. Thank you :)",[2],[2]
5600,"You took the words right out of my mouth!

Please know too, that good medical and mental health professionals exist.  The good ones dont judge and theyre trained to give you the support you need in the hardest times.

I feel that your husband is being supportive in his own way. Making light of the diagnosis, showing that it doesn't matter to him and that you are still the same person he loves and cherishes.

Things like this...they don't just get better. Quite the opposite. Without hard work and *buy-in* by your husband, this is only going to spiral deeper.

But if you gotta toot, you gotta toot. Dont hold back. Since you have kids Im assuming hes seen you naked, changed diapers, experienced all the weird gross things bodies do. He shouldnt be acting like youre doing something evil but farting or burping.

Don't know if this helps, but remember that parenthood is a joint effort.

There will be things only you can handle in the future. 

And 1 year-olds are difficult. They can be monsters! I don't know a single parent with a 1 year old (especially not the first one) that rides on pink fluffy clouds, so to speak ;) They all love their kids, but they all say it's ""sooooo goooood to finally get out for a while"". ",[],[2]

Also, I am a grandparent who helps take care of my granddaughter.  My daughter is in medical school and I will do all I can to help her.  I think many grandparents have that mindset.  I didn't have any help when my kids were young, so I know what it's like.  I help because I've been there.",[2],[2]
4979,"I think this is awesome. Not only does it allow you to remain functioning adults who have their own personalities outside of ""mommy and daddy,"" but it also allows the kids to build strong relationships with their grandparents, and sends a clear message that both family and alone time are important for a healthy life and healthy marriage. It also fosters independence in your kids and shows them it's okay to spend time away from home. Plus I'm sure your parents love being able to spend time with their grandkids, so everyone wins here!

I think it helps that my wife and I were a bit older when we started our family; if we'd had kids in our early twenties, we probably would have bought into the prevailing wisdom that you have to spend [every waking moment with your kids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attachment_parenting).

Not somehow, you turned them by keying his car, calling the other woman and verbally attacking her, and then airing out your dirty laundry on facebook. I'm not saying that he's not the bad guy, you both are at this point. Feeling angry isn't an excuse for this behavior and if your anger really drove you to do those things maybe you need anger management.

You're pregnant and not working, what are your options if you're looking to move out? Family? If not that then what about couples counseling? These are things you should think about when you're more clearheaded. 

If anything can you go stay with a loved one for a couple of days? Just to physically remove yourself from the situation. If I were in your shoes, the mere act of him existing near me would set me off, so I think leaving for a bit would be good. Or ask him to leave. Either or! 

This isn't the end of the world, you're hurt and angry and fucking pregnant! Take it five minutes at a time. If not that, then two minutes at a time. ",[1],[]

Now it feels like I'm begging for him to stay!! ",[2],[3]
13590,"You look like the bad guy cuz you did bad guy things. Don't get me wrong though, so did he. Lying and possibly emotionally cheating is pretty bad.

I resent my mother so much for staying in an unhappy marriage which has affected both my sister and my ability to be in happy romantic relationships. 

The model of love you're showing them is flawed and doing lasting damage to them. Ideally, children should have two parents who love each other as role models. Parents staying together and resenting each other is no substitute for this. They'll be better knowing that when a partner is not upholding their vows, you have to have self respect enough leave.

Seriously though, hi-5 to you and your wife!
I had a very similar experience to you, my son was 5lb2oz at birth and struggled to latch on. I also sobbed my eyes out when he first fed successfully so I really sympathise with you and your wife.

4189,Could you give an example of someone's reaction of a name indicating their personality?,[1],[1]
4193,"Hmm. Google gives Yuri/Uri as my flame, Gods flame or light of God. It cant literally be of God since it doesnt end in El, but the Internet seems to think it relates to flame and god. Oh well, thanks for the correction.",[1],[1]
4186,"It also means something along the lines of ""light of God"" in Hebrew. I feel like this one isn't going to be an issue.

4188,"Not to mention that Yuri is a common Russian type name. Ie. Yuri Gagarin.

My wife has a step-cousin named Juri (pronounced Yuri) because the mother is Estonian. So it's cultural.

That one I'm ok with... ",[2],[1]

4196,Wait whats the made up one?,[1],[1]
4187,"Yeah. Yuri is one of the tame ones among the others. Plus, as people get older, how people react to your name can give a good gauge on their personality.",[1],[1]
4192,"Yup. Yuri isn't a word in Hebrew other than Russian people with that name.. Orel is ""light of God"" where  'or' is light and 'el' is God. ",[1],[1]
4185,"Yuri also means lotus flower in Japanese 

Edit: it actually means lily. Thank you for pointing that out ",[1],[1]

10475,"Social risks? Don't tell anyone then. Issues for the kids? Don't fuck around them. Emotional risks? Sex always carries an emotional risk, that's always a concern and shouldn't need to be stated. No one is saying ""it's perfectly fine because it's incest"". All I'm saying is, there's not really much difference between her and some lady that's not his cousin. He should consider sleeping with her the same way he considers sleeping with any other woman, which does NOT mean just jumping into it without considering the risks.

Also I even said ""OP can make the choice of whether or not there's a risk of drama/mental health."" What did you think that meant?",[1],[2]

I followed your wife's posts and I've been following yours and all I can say is to talk to a lawyer and make sure you save all the nasty texts she sent you. If you don't end this relationship, it will continue to mess you up and it will mess our kids up.

You need to get away from your abusers (whether you want to admit it's happening or not) and get some perspective and help.  You've lost your self worth and you need to find some way to get it back but it won't happen until you get away.

5202,"Happy birthday to your son, he sounds like an awesome little guy. I don't think they have ever disclosed their childrens' diagnoses, but you may find some comfort in the Colin's Friends Facebook page. It started similar to the story it sounds like your family is experiencing; a mother of a child with special needs was fed up and disappointed in the lack of participation and support from her son's classmates and their families, so she created the page as a surprise for her son, hoping to gain birthday wishes to remind him that plenty of people cared about him. The page exploded and now, years later, they post frequent updates and share the difficult but rewarding road of raising children with special needs!",[1],[2]
5193,I'm assuming your son is in a typical school- but wanted to say you guys should try to find some other autism parents in your area that have kids near your kids ages. Autism parents all know how important showing up is and also have kids that they're trying to socialize. Maybe you can do a MeetUp or something to try and locate some playdates? I started one in my area when my son was diagnosed at 3 and we have been friends with that same crew for 7 years already!  Glad the birthday went well!,[2],[2]

I myself left a church I consider a cult a few months ago, while for different reasons than you. This particular church seems to be less about God and more about sex, family, and earthly things. Jesus says store up treasures in heaven, which sounds nothing like what you describe. ",[2],[2]
9282,"Thank you! It was kind of hard to get away, again my family was very important to the church so I was usually given special treatment, so getting out was easier for me than if is for others. Its way harder to get out of you get married and have kids within the church. ",[2],[2]

56635," In order to get past exactly that, I would trick myself. I would go to bed, and set an alarm on my phone for an hour later, knowing that I was so exhausted all the time that I would fall asleep right away. When my alarm went off after an hour I would wake up just long enough to put the mask on and then go back to sleep, to be awakened at the right time by my other alarm so I could get up and go to work. That worked for about a month, and ever since then I have not needed to do it anymore.

 It is totally possible to adapt to the mask. The annoying phase of ripping it off in the night is just another thing to push through. You got this.",[3],[2]
56632,I do customer service for a respiratory company and you wouldnt believe how many people call in with the same complaint try using it at night before going to bed while reading or watching tv it helps you get used to it while your awake. Most people tear it off at night because its unfamiliar if that doesnt work try a new mask! There are literally hundreds out there and sometimes it takes a few tries to find the right one!,[2],[1]
56648,I have pretty much not been able to sleep on my back for my entire adult life. Additionally I would never be able to sleep with a mask strapped to my face.,[3],[1]
56601,I was worried about tearing the mask off in the night as well. I kept it on last night so hopefully it won't be an issue. They make a few different style masks you could try. Personally I use the nasal mask where it just goes over my nose. I definitely suggest you try to make it work because sleep apnea is associated with an increased risk for a whole host of diseases.,[2],[2]
56600,"I went to try a CPAP machine after one of my previous girlfriends was scared I was dying in the night. Not breathing for 30 seconds to a minute sporadically through the night tends to unnerve the ones sleeping next to you.

I tried it for a bit, but I kept tearing off the mask in my sleep. I'm jealous you are able to sleep with it on, but it might be because I'm a side sleeper, although you make a good point about not being able to breathe on your back.

Maybe I should try one again...

Edit: wow, I'm overwhelmed with the responses. Thank you to everyone who has given me advice! I'll be going to my doctor about looking into an oral appliance.

Thank you again!",[3],[]

I have a ResMed S9 APAP machine and I use the ResMed Quattro FX mask.

I love my machine. If someone tried to take it away from me I would literally kill them.",[2],[2]
56647,"Idk what mask you used but they make ones specifically for side sleepers. Mine has the hose at the top of my head, and the mask comes down with a little breathing nose piece that goes under my nose. The mask is squishy so it compresses when you lay on it. Took me awhile to get used to but once I did it was glorious!",[2],[2]

Additionally he was falling asleep at work and at the wheel of his car on the road.  I laid down the law and insisted that he use the machine he already had.  He would rip the mask off and I would wake up and slug him in whatever I could reach.  After a few months he can sleep straight through the night without my physical ""reminders"".  ",[3],[1]

Thats not only wrong, but its also traumatizing to the child.

14653,"Props to you and your kids!

Don't forget to get the legal aspects right though! Get a lawyer, get full custody while she is still out ""enjoying"" her new life.

14660,They will do it at some point either because they feel guilty or they just want to hurt you. The person who ends up getting hurt is the child...and then you hurt because you cant stand to see your child hurting. It sucks.,[1],[2]
14655,"This exact thing happened to a close friend of mine! Her daughters father wanted nothing to do with his kid (he finally met her for the first time when she was a preschooler). When the kid was school-age, his parents (who he lived with) kept pushing for visits. My friend, who lived out of state, sent her daughter to visit with her dad and grandparents a few times. One visit, they decided to just not give her back and file for custody instead. It took about a year, a lot of money, an attorney and many court dates (plus a domestic violence arrest of the father) before she finally got her kid back. Both parents have equal rights as long as paternity has been established. ",[3],[2]
14656,"Wow! What a horrible family! I was fortunate enough to have, not only my family on my side, but his family on my side as well. That went a long way in court when he had nobody except his wife to stand on his side. Glad your friend is past that now. ",[2],[2]
14657,"Yeah, it was pretty sad. She had been a single mom for all those years, he was super behind on support and never paid her.

There's not a lot of porn where there's an equal exchange of pleasure and affection.  People don't like feeling used, especially during sexual activity because that is when they're vulnerable.

They had to work hard and have even been in counseling together as well as individually and seem happier than ever. ",[2],[2]

From the way you describe him, it doesn't necessarily seem like a lost cause. He just needs to learn how to manage expectations and communicate better than pouting. To be honest, the clinginess is only half the problem--it's the fact that he's so emotionally childlike that you have to literally cannot relax around him for fear of upsetting him in some way. Is he controlling or manipulative in any way, especially with his emotions?",[3],[2]

1. You seem like a good parent! 
2. I was like this when I was a child, I turned out pretty well. I have mild motivation issues but they stem from many different things.

Either way, try not to let it worry you too much.

7920,"School is not for smart people. Its impossible to expect children, who all have different abilities and minds, to follow the exact same rules and teaching mechanisms. 

As a mom of a smart toddler, I plan to do as much teaching as I can through touch, play and nature when she is not in school. This is why the Montessori philosophy of teaching is my favourite.. if only it wasnt so expensive! ",[2],[2]
7919,"Seriously, I could have written this myself. This is EXACTLY my son. He is incredibly smart and we were so disheartened when within 3 weeks of starting school, we were pulled aside for the first time by his teacher to have that conversation. Broke our hearts. Ever since then, every year we play the game of how long will it take before the new teacher asks us to come in and see her?
Its exhausting, disheartening and makes you feel like your failing as a parent. 
As somebody that toiled through IVF for years to even be able to have my son, I feel like Im not worthy of the gift. ",[3],[3]
7911,"Thats awesome! I can only imagine the feeling! Your son probably feels completely differently about school now too. 
I hope your son continues to thrive with teachers who provide an environment in which he feels comfortable, it makes such a huge difference. Hes blessed to have parents like you as well who have been there to support him.",[1],[3]

4081,"> Hearing my feelings validated. I keep getting told to put on a strong face, don't feel this, don't feel that - but I'm a person who feels very deeply.

You can not control your feelings any more than you can control the weather.  This took me longer than I care to admit to learn.

Counseling has helped me to identify and process those feelings in a healthy and constructive way. 

For example, the guilt. I know in my head I could not have prevented what happened to my niece.  I didn't know how to contact my sister. I couldn't call CPS on a gut feeling.  However, I still feel that guilt, though not nearly as much, in my ""heart."" Feelings aren't logical.  

Being strong does not mean you stop feeling.

I can be fairly shy sometimes and painfully shy when it comes to guys/relationships (so therefore I am not looking) so I always try to shut stuff like that down, but in a light hearted way. But I think if a relationship is what *you* want you may need to come out of your shell a bit more or at least make it known that you are indeed **looking**...

Theyre generally big business burning through cash like crazy building tons of infastructure, rising tuition, and adding more overhead. I think the silver lining for this tax plan is it forces colleges to start paying grads the salary they deserve.

This is why having schools funded locally is kind of shitty because it creates such a huge gap in education.,[2],[3]
7221,"Daaamn, can kids REALLY mess your life up that bad though? Maybe in US where healthcare and time off for families is not provided? Idk... ",[1],[2]
7220,"I think a lot of parents feel this way. It's a taboo subject to be honest about so it's something rarely discussed. My sister was 40 and had a baby with a complete idiot that ruined the life she had before. Now she says, ""at least I have my son."" I think it's complete bullshit. She went from a state job and owning her own business to welfare. That's an extreme example, but you're a human being with human emotions. It's ok to feel how you feel.",[3],[3]
7227,"I was so worried, coming in, that they'd try to brush it all over with butwhatabouts (smiles, giggles, Kodak moments), itllgetbetterswhens, or - worse - shaming. I am very relieved.",[1],[2]
7222,"It was a combination of lots of things. The kid's dad is an idiot, the kid has some special needs, bad decisions on her part, and she was left holding the bag for everything.",[3],[]
7212,"The best you can do right now is work around the kids. Get someone to watch them a couple evenings so you can spend time with your husband or get a manicure. Treat yourself to some nice underwear. Maybe not as often as before but sometimes. Leave the kids with their grandparents and go on a holiday just with your husband. Have sex everywhere again. It doesn't have to be black and white. You don't want to feel like you sacrificed something. This won't do any good to you nor the children. Trust me, I was an accident and always felt like my mom regretted me - it's not a great feeling. Try to squeeze out as much for yourself as you can. We only have this one life. ",[],[3]
7219,What thread did you read?,[1],[1]
7223,"Yes it's bad in America.  For the vast majority, both parents have to work full time jobs to have a normal quality of life.  Maternity leave is far from guranteed.  Vacation time is even less so.  Prices for basic staples keep going up while wages stagnate.  Public schools generally are worse than not good, they are a detriment to children.  ",[1],[2]
7225,"Yes the US makes it very difficult and expensive... No daycare, no support, maternity leave is iffy. I could go on and I  but it's too depressing. ",[1],[2]
7216,"You homeschool though. Otherwise you'd be waking up at the ass crack of dawn every weekday. At least that's how I remember life as a school aged kid. Everything else sounds spot on and realistic for the general population though, I think. Coming from someone without kids who couldn't be a stay at home mom.",[2],[2]
12596,Go find your happiness. You are totally allowed. <3,[1],[2]
12603,Im actually the breadwinner,[2],[1]
12592,"It's okay.

You're not horrible, just human. You and this person you married want different things. 

The world will still spin and things will go on. It's totally up to you.

I think the moping's probably a little about someone who is slowly realizing their convenience window is about to shrink. He'll live, and so will you. Don't put the kid in the middle and be adults about it and it's going to be okay.",[1],[3]
12597,"Not only is it okay, at this point you need to. For yourself, for your child, for your sanity. I spent over a year dragging my feet before my divorce but it was the best decision I ever made. I only wish I made the decision sooner. It will be one of the hardest things you ever do. But there is such happiness on the other side!",[2],[3]
12593,"Something about the simplicity of looking at it like this helps. I appreciate it, thank you",[1],[2]
12601,Thank you. I hope Im strong enough to do this. The financial aspect is terrifying.,[2],[2]
12602,"This is a bit controversial, but are you working at all?  I sometimes feel like the man's role as a breadwinner can be a lot to take on, and it can quickly become a source of resentment.  I only mention it, because you might find you both regain some happiness if you were financially independent and not relying on him to pay for everything such as therapy.  I know raising kids is difficult, but even some part time work where you can get some personal spending money or something might be good.",[1],[3]
12598,What was your situation like? What drove you to do it?,[1],[1]
12600,"You have one life to live and you never know how much time you have left. Do you want to spend the rest of your time here being unhappy for the sake of not making someone else unhappy? You already know the answer to this. Now reclaim your life for yourself. You'll also be setting a good example for your child. They'll see that it's ok if things don't work out and if they're ever in a similar situation when they're older, they'll remember your strength and will have the courage to make the best decision for themselves. 

Get things in order. Start coming up with a game plan and have a few backup plans, too. 

I'm sorry that you're in this spot but I really hope that this is one of your first steps in finding happiness. ",[1],[3]
12594,"you will be ok and so will he. If you are unhappy, he likely is too. You might both be staying because it's 'easier', but think of your kid. You guys deserve to be fulfilled, and your kid is better off with two parents free to find what they need in life.",[1],[3]
7844,"And have your children raised by the bottom of the barrel instead? Low wage employment is not going to buy nice day care. Also, working all week with nothing to show for it and having your children in an environment worse than your own home does't sound particularly rewarding.  ",[1],[2]
7839,"Could you possibly look into government childcare assistance? It could be worth looking into, and if you aren't sure if you can retain the assistance if you get a job, social services could answer your questions about how much income is too much income to qualify to see if it is worth it.",[1],[1]
7842,Doesn't matter. Psychologically you need to work. Even if all your money goes to child care. Do it. You will feel much better.,[1],[2]
7838,Exactly this. The local centers around here charge $165 a week per child. The monthly cost would be two weeks of work at my husband's current pay rate. Finding a job to supplement that may not even be worth it.,[2],[2]
7845,"I don't know -- wouldn't it be better for your kids if they weren't being raised full time by somebody who doesn't (I don't think this is the right word but it's the best I have)  resent them?  It might be better to work if only to pay for a nanny if that is what keeps you going.

My mom had to put her ambitions on hold because of her children (long story) and it effected us in a fairly profound ways. We weren't mistreated -- but we were affected ",[],[2]
7843,"If you don't have the money, it's not an option. ",[1],[1]
7836,"It's okay. This isn't your bag. 

Get a job. Get therapy for your kids. 

You need adult time too. ",[1],[1]
7841,Look into services that use Applied Behavior Analyses. (I know I posted this further down). I cannot recommend strongly enough how important it is that you find a program that use it. Most insurance companies cover a good bit of the fees too. Look into Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention programs near by! Good luck!,[1],[3]
7840,"That's something worth looking into. We fall just outside the bracket when it comes to wic and stuff, so that might be the case again. Can't hurt to try though",[2],[2]

9666,"A few students out of hundreds not liking her teaching style is normal. Ive hated teachers Ive had in the past because I felt like I never learned a damn thing from the way they taught. 


But 275 other students loved them so maybe it means they all suck and only I was the smart one to avoid the dingbat. ",[2],[2]
9665,Check out her students' reviews on her classes. People would change their entire syllabuses so they could avoid her class because she's such a dingbat.,[1],[]
9661,"I cried too. So did my eight and thirteen year old self who couldnt talk because of people like her. I just cant believe the anger towards Dr Ford. Its like she betrayed some secret code and talked- oh wait...Good women and men are finding their voice. We need to support them all. 
Edit: spelling",[2],[3]
9660,"I'm 47M live in middle upper class neighborhood in Cincinnati. I was at the high school football game last night. Simply amazed the at the number of educated ignorant women who live here. They were talking about how their son's in college had to protect themselves. Is it possible they didn't listen to the same testimony I did. I was in tears throughout Dr. Ford's testimony. Then Kavanaugh's shit show confirmed to me everything I thought about him. Honestly...if Kavanaugh had spoken with quiet composure and humility, he may have been more believable. My daughter is 17. I've been warning her and her friends about men who drink since she was 9. I've told her the most trusting father and husband after drinking isn't to be trusted alone. I've known too many good women sidelined by 1 bad experience.",[3],[3]
9667,Nah. Students generally don't take the time to write reviews on professors unless they are exceptionally bad at their jobs.,[1],[1]
9668,"No youd be surprised. Some students just write bad reviews because theyre idiots who didnt pass the class. I myself wrote a bad interview for a class I failed out of spite. Trust me, students will make time to spite teachers they dont like. ",[2],[2]
9664,"Public opinion is always shoot first and ask questions later. Thats how its always been. Thats also why the US isnt a true democracy but instead a representative republic. Were supposed to have legal safeguards against this, but weve seen the current administration blend the two into this obscene monster that takes from both but respects neither. ",[1],[2]
9659,"She is reality, she and women /men like her are the reason that Trump got elected, the only thing we can do is show up in November and vote, don't get complacent and don't be fooled, there are many people like her , that hold her beliefs, that don't speak up in public.",[1],[]
9662,Theyre the upper echelon. They hate it when people like Ford tell the truth. The truth is bad news for the status theyve come to know. This woman and Kavanaugh are of the same privileged breed...they naturally look out for each other. They may be educated but that doesnt mean theyre good people.,[1],[]
9663,"Whats odd to me is that Dr. Ford PhD is also of the same background (as Kavanaugh and possibly the Bosss wife) and she is a victim. How can anyone sit there and believe an educated and successful woman who was demeaned and scared is the one who is wrong?

Its not only about the echelon. We live in a shoot the messenger society too. 

Also not to justify any aggressors but I think we do in fact live in a Guilty until proven innocent court of public opinion. 

Both are toxic and need to be stopped. It is going to be hard in my opinion because of the way that society handles bad news. ",[1],[3]

2543,"Please don't think this is your fault at all. I've been in a similar situation and have kept it to myself for years so I know how much it can eat you up inside. My step father never outright said anything that blunt but he used to do really creepy things like not let me keep my door closed to my room at night, buy me skimpy stockings and clothes and offer to take my pictures in them (I trashed them), talk about my body. He was obsessed with trying to take photos of me. Looking back at them makes me sick because they look so sexualized (the poses, the angles).

They might be happy about it but be very overbearing and gossipy.  They insist on big celebrations for everything regardless of what he or I want and we don't like to bring a lot of attention to ourselves in that way.

Could be projection on his part.

You said he didn't help on raising the first child, he then promised he'd help with the second, he didn't do that either.

And the night before he again did not participate but did his own thing, for himself only. ""try to keep the girls crying to a minimum because he was at a good point in his show and that would kill his vibe.""

At the end of the day its the footprints you leave on their hearts that really matter. I teared up writing this (I guess its time to tell my stepdad how important he is to me).

A father is the one to help you with schoolwork, teaches you how to ride a bike and take you to hospital when you have a scary fever, and worries when you come home late.

Your wife is really lucky to have you. I couldn't possibly imagine your daily struggle but your dedication to her is admirable, and your frustrations are understandable.

The thing that happened last time she went to therapy was after a few months she just kinda figured that there wasn't much else that the therapist could tell her to help her out. The therapist gave her tools and things to work on, and she figured she could just work on it herself without the therapy. I'm going to try and get her to stay going longer this time though.

I'm the man on the other end of this, that did this to his wife for several consecutive months. I, after the faithful help of my loving wife, finally came to my senses. I still play with friends, but maybe 4hrs a week now. 

After some introspection, I found out that I was battling depression  due to stressors. Situations that I kept inside, I couldn't find a way to talk to her. I chose to keep it all inside and video games were my escapism. Don't harp on him about the gaming, don't try to medicate the symptoms.

11833,So he's sending unsolicited dick pics to random girls?  Just because someone says they send nudes doesn't mean that its true.  Nor does it mean that they want random guys sending them pics.  That's harrassement.  If this is a release for him that is between consenting adults that is one issue that could be fairly harmless. If it remains online only with little to no other communication between him and individual women then perhaps a discussion needs to be had on boundaries you need him to abide by.  But if these women are not welcoming his pics then that is a huge red flag in regards to how he treats and views women.  Regardless you need to have a serious talk with him in regards to your feelings and how this effects relationship.  There is no shame in making a bad choice in life if you learn from it.,[1],[3]

But there's no excuse for cheating, in my eyes. None. I'd rather be alone than married to a man who would do that to me. Even worse if you have kids...why risk your family??

Everyone will experience child birth and parenting differently, some mother's will suffer postpartum while others will be madly in love with their newborn. I would recommend researching on how pregnancy will affect the body, the appropriate diet and self care required for each trimester, and the initial steps when the baby is delivered. Knowing what to expect will make you more confident whether you want a child or not. Even asking your colleagues directly about how they dealt with their pregnancy can shed new light, so take your time and discover both the horrors and beauty of raising a child. ",[1],[3]

Im pretty sure that when Im ready to make the transition into motherhood in a few years time I will want to get a C-section. I know that there are complications after this surgery but I would much rather prefer that then being in labor for 24 hours. I think that life after pregnancy is what worries me the most. I feel that I would never want anything bad to happen to my kid and knowing that you dont really have any control over the negative things that can happen is what brings about a greater anxiety.

Perhaps at some point, if you feel like you want to try something, you could look at temporary fostering. Kids of all ages, including babies, require a temp home of days or weeks til a proper placement is found. If you feel very undecided on kids, that might help you decide.

15954,Yes and put it in your office at work. I am 23 and my dad has one or two of my kid drawings framed in his office and it warms both out hearts,[2],[2]
15953,You HAVE to frame that drawing!,[1],[2]
15957,You need a copy so the original can be sealed in an archival envelope and kept in a temperature and humidity controlled clean vault.,[1],[1]
15956,"Yup, scan it, print out another and save it digitally.  Can't have too many copies, really.",[1],[2]
8623,"I know what you mean. Its not the same, but I can relate because my mom had a miscarriage, and as she was in the hospital hooked up to a bunch of wires and still not recovered, her friends came into the room to meet her and when they came in they started talking about JCP deals to each other, completely ignoring my mom. After a few minutes, I couldnt bear it and I told them to get the fuck out of the room.
I sometimes wonder how people can be so oblivious to anothers pain.",[3],[3]
8624,"I'm sorry for what you've been through. I had an emergency c-section at week 34 due to pre-eclampsia and no, NICU is no fun and neither is having a teeny tiny baby which you cannot hold or bring home right away.

Your ""friend"" is horrible. Pregnancy brain (aka the crazies) can't even explain her awful behavior. ",[3],[2]
8629,"If you dont want to necessarily end the friendship with these people, you will have to at least be on guard. There will most likely be more of this type of vocal diarrhea coming out of her as your children grow up. For example, my kid has a speech delay, didnt speak til 4, I was excited when he started saying certain phrases, another friend stomped on my excitement saying Oh, my LO has been saying that since she was 18 months!  No shit. ",[2],[2]
8621,That was seriously insensitive of her. Im really sorry for what youre going through. I dont think you should call her your friend anymore.,[1],[2]
8630,"The one uppers...
Just celebrate all childrens success! Its a very easy concept that some find so difficult ",[1],[2]
8626,"We succeeded after 2 years and 2 miscarriages, so when my friends get impatient after only trying for a month, I get upset but try not to take it personally... because its literally not about me.

And this isnt about you either. It hurts when people are insensitive but often its not targeted at anyone in particular. People (especially pregnant ones) say silly stuff. Just avoid her and focus on your little one.

",[3],[2]
8627,"Wow, shes a real idiot for doing that. 

And Im sorry that you had to go through such awful time and youve lost a baby. ",[1],[2]
8622,"Yea I dont think I will. I hand knitted her a baby blanket and dont think Ill be giving it to her anymore. My husband and I will stay friends with her husband, but I dont think either of us want to be around his wife again. Hearing her name right now makes my skin crawl. ",[2],[]
8625,"Yea it was definitely her regular ole stupid brain and not her pregnancy brain.  Shes youngish, but so am I. I think she thinks having a baby is having your own personal dress up doll. They got preggo on accident and we had to actively try for around 7 months. I think when I was in the hospital it was all anybody could talk about in town and so she may think theres glamour in crisis. ",[2],[2]
8628,"Yeah, I'd say F her and stay away from her. Seems like a complete asshole! ",[1],[2]
10407,"Ahw cheers! Also, really? Like what/who? :o Yeah of course! Just hope it helps, I know it might not be worth shit right now. But on the off-chance that it could help, I figured I should go for anyway ^^",[1],[2]
10413,"Ha! Thats exactly what I say when people make broad generalisations about Americans before they realise I am one. 

Also, I bet youre a rarity in the West Country. Im not surprised you get a million questions.",[2],[2]
10410,"Haha sounds like a good idea!!! I do have to admit that when I meet people from other countries I ask the same questions  just to build a picture I suppose! Or maybe just being nose! 

I also find it funny when some of my friends from here introduce me to someone else saying this is x. She is from...  really bizarre! 

Dont take it to heart! They (mainly) mean well! ",[2],[2]
10409,How do you feel about bourbons though?,[1],[1]
10399,"It doesn't break community rules, it's just horribly insensitive and more than a little self-centered. You seem to completely lack self-awareness and are dismissive of the experience of other immigrants. Being an immigrant means never belonging fully to your new country. It often means being discriminated against for the color of your skin, for your cultural practices, for your religion, and having your children and their children face the same difficulties as you even though they were born and raised just because they look a certain way. As a white US->UK immigrant, your experience lacks the racial aspect of why it's difficult to be an immigrant. For you to effectively dismiss someone whose experiences as an immigrant have almost certainly been much more difficult than yours is insensitive and demonstrates a profound self-centeredness that doesn't make you easy to sympathize with.",[1],[3]
10417,"Kiwis are pretty awesome all told. I do love living here, and my experience is good 95% of the time! 

But there are times it's tough. When Vegas happened, I actually stayed home from work because I didn't want to deal with the questions and comments.take care of yourself and keep being awesome, and have a great day!",[2],[2]
10402,We use knives and forks in America too.....,[1],[1]
10408,"We're British. We like talking. We find your background interesting. I'm British Indian, born in England. I get it all the time",[2],[2]
10395,"Welcome to the experience of immigrants all over the world. I am an Indian who has lived in America for 9 years now and I still come across this at times. This is normal for people and it's okay to feel frustration but it is also alright to acknowledge that you will never truly belong the way that natives do. You belong to both cultures. Acknowledge it, appreciate it, and accept it. And feel free to point out that stereotypes work in both directions. I love to tell Americans what I grew up thinking they did as an Indian. That shuts them down fast and it creates dialogue and allows them to introspect.",[3],[3]
10418,You don't use knives and forks in America?,[1],[1]
4540,"> ""Clinton in the office is just bad news"" 

Im sorry this was a perfectly valid reason to not vote for her its the RNC and the DNC's fault for being so out of touch with their bases that we got handed two shit candidates.",[1],[1]
4538,"But it's NOT just backwater hillbillies, and that's the problem. It's the kids that really just as old as me (22) saying that we ""need to protect the country from terrorists"" or "" we can't have a war with Russia."" It's the old people who think that ""another Clinton in the office is just bad news"" or that ""free medical care is bullshit, back in my day bla bla bla. ""

There are obvious stereotypes that do exist but these are just average people. Why is it so hard to see that this is all very and truly wrong? That we made a choice based on lies and deceit?",[1],[2]
4543,"Good. I did as well. Would have rather had Bernie but second best will do, even if second best is a steaming pile of garbage. I'd rather have a steaming pile of garbage than a quasi-fascist Reality TV star running the show.",[1],[2]

4535,"I've just watched 4 of his videos and don't feel like he makes a lot of good points. Granted, I watched mostly political videos (gun rights, trump) so we're probably not starting at a good place anyway.

Do you have particular episodes that you feel highlight his channel best? ",[1],[1]
4541,If you really cannot tell how She was clearly a better option than the Benito Cheeto then I'm really sorry.,[1],[2]
4537,"It's because  some people need someone to blame, and the backwater hillbillies can't imagine that anyone white could ever do anything wrong. (Pennsyltucky citizen here.) They're the ones still living in the 1800s when women and blacks didn't have voting rights and ""america was great.""",[1],[1]
4536,"Nah but it's ok right? Since trump won the elections now we can just go around asking all the ""dirty mexicans"" here if they belong or not.

It's not like the USA has an absolutely MASSIVE Hispanic population or anything and it's not like they're doing anything other than TOOK ER JERBS so what does it matter?

Why? Why is race still such a massive problem? Why are we so ignorant as human beings to judge by skin color or accent or what country we come from? Why can't we be judged by how hard we work or how much we benefit society as a whole?

It's really petty and pathetic how we're treating people in the name of ""Making America Great Again.""",[1],[1]

6391,"Backing this one up. Choose your state well and start anew. I understand that starting over won't be easy but it's doable and you will get to choose who is in your life. Because we usually don't choose that much, family is imposed and friends we make at work or at school and if the environment does not propose the same values that you have, you end up with a bunch of assholes. Do not hurt yourself, you seem like a strong lady and we need strong lady. I would've done the same. PM me if you need support or just to chat, I'm sure others have offered, please do it, don't stay alone in this.",[],[3]
6386,"Firstly, please don't do anything to harm yourself. This is absolutely something that will get better with time. 

I don't usually think of leaving the state as a viable option to escape one's turmoil but I think that's a very good idea here. Do you have the means? You said you took money to get a house... did you buy it? Can you get out? As you said, there's nothing for you there anymore. Even though this may blow over eventually, the damage it could do in the mean time could push you over the edge. Get out of that town, better yet the state, and don't tell them where you're going. None of them. Perhaps in the future you can have a relationship with your parents again but only if you want to.",[],[2]
6382,"I am not far from your town and I know quite a few people out and around the area who can offer any help if you need it, myself included. 

Please, don't do anything to yourself. I had a strange similar situation and please believe that you will get past this",[],[2]
6385,"I am so angry hearing about this, that a town can turn against a person so completely. And what if she had chosen to have the baby? Would they have given all the necessary support? I believe not. 

I have a lot of relatives in rural PA, and seen first hand the judgey conservative small-mindedness that runs rampant in places like that. I am filled with anxiety every time I visit that place. 

Fuck PA in general, and religious small town conservative politics in particular. The only good solution may be to move away and let these people pat each other on the back and nod in agreement until they die. ",[2],[3]
6384,"I'm from that area originally and it is a shithole of bigotry and generally not so great people. Some good ones, of course, but mostly not in my experience. 

OP, I'm so sorry you had to go through this. If you need someone to talk to feel free to PM me. I'll be in the area this weekend if you need to get out or need someone to talk to just to get the weight off your chest.",[2],[2]
6387,My advice also. Get the fuck outta there!,[1],[]
6389,Same. /u/Ceno-bitten said it best: there's nothing there holding you back anymore. That town has *nothing* to offer you. I wouldn't hold my breath for forgiveness; just be rid of them.,[1],[]
6394,This. I hope that piece of shit sees justice for killing that dog. The story makes it sound like it was almost definitely him.  He had a motive. He indicated it was a revenge killing because of the abortion. Please press charges. And get a restraining order. He needs to fucking pay.,[3],[3]
6383,"This. So sorry this happened to you OP. I've heard some bad things from friends about the Erie/western PA area in regards to bigots/etc. but I'm mortified to hear that this happened to you. I'm probably a bit further from you (about 3 hours east), but if there's anything I can do to help/if you just need someone to talk to, I'd be more than willing.

Best wishes!",[2],[2]
6390,"Yeah seriously /u/tossoutaccoutn233, that's my recommendation too. Also for the time being delete all of your social media. It might not completely stop your ex from tracking you but hopefully no one else will be able to. Change all your passwords if he has any of them.

Move as far away as you can. There has to be somewhere for you to go, but there's nothing for you in Erie anymore.

I'm so sorry about your dog, and please don't harm yourself. You did what you thought was right. Raising a child with Down's is a gargantuan task and it's not for everybody.",[3],[2]
5538,:p it's okay. it's nice having someone to talk to though. It sucks that i'm still such a night owl because of college. everybody else is asleep.,[2],[2]
5532,Big hugs. I'm glad he finally managed to ask for help.,[1],[2]
5539,I don't even start to feel tired until 3am. I know those feels. I have to remind myself to go to bed because otherwise I'll either oversleep or only get 4-5 hours. Video games and losing track of time kinda screwed me in that respect,[2],[2]
5541,"I'm debating where I'm going career-wise, but if things end up the way I'd like I can work my own hours from home so that kind of thing wouldn't be an issue for me. By the same token I have friends who get themselves to bed before 10pm and wake up before 8am who are so much more productive than me on a daily basis that I can't help but be jealous",[2],[2]
5533,"Incredible. It takes a true man to overcome that himself. You know you're lucky to have him. Most people I know would want him to keep that bottled up and basically ""suck it up."" He's lucky to have someone like you who cares about what's best for him. I'm glad he came out the other side of that abyss. Love, prayers, and vibes OP",[1],[2]
5535,"My dad went through that. He was always mister ""Never let the kids see you cry."" Then his business partner passed away. Since he's actually been able to say ""I'm worried that this might happen or"" ""I thought of him again and I got really sad."" He feels ""weaker"" now that he talks about his feelings. My family is trying really hard to ask him how he's feeling so he'll keep telling us his feelings and reminding him that it doesn't mean he's too weak to keep us from worrying. It means he's strong enough to trust us with something so valuable and private to him. 

You honestly don't seem to need much more advice because you're right where my family was after the incident. It gets easier with time",[3],[2]
5537,"Wow, your life is like ""Little Miss Sunshine"" i feel kinda silly offering advice now. Haha",[1],[2]
5534,if he had his way he'd keep it bottled up. we talk a lot but it isn't always easy for him to express how he feels. i'm just thankful that now he'll see even he has his limit and he doesn't have to fight his demons alone.,[3],[2]
5540,me too. we're both gamers and i haven't gone to bed before midnight in five years! my husbands sleep pattern gets messed up pretty easily due to his job but he's also dealt with insomnia. Yet he can function on three hours sleep if need be.,[3],[2]
5536,yeah it does get easier with time. my older brother has struggled with mental health issues all his life and essentially can't even live on his own.,[3],[2]
10668,Damn redditors are not very tactful are they? I can't imagine what I'd do if I was stuck in such a situation. But how could she have manipulated him really! How did he react/justify himself? Just how drunk he was makes the difference between rape and cheating.,[1],[2]
10672,"Dont make excuses for either one of them.  Shes not your best friend, and at this point she isnt even acting like a mom.  Shes acting like a garbage person.  Same goes for your husband. Being drunk is not a good enough excuse for what went down and the fact that you still want to be with him is unsettling.  Ditch him and find someone that treats you with respect.  ",[1],[3]
10673,I walked in on my ex with another woman that I didn't even know. Ended up taking him back due to low self esteem. Sank into a very deep depression and he betrayed me in even worse ways. Build your self esteem please. Also if you stay the relationship might deteriorate anyway even if you try to forgive and forget it will haunt you. I'm sorry this happened to you. I'm still pretty jaded to relationships even though I'm no longer bitter or depressed. Take care of you okay!,[3],[3]
10670,Id say cut all ties with your mom- shes not your friend if she would do something like that.,[1],[2]
10665,"Its not really that I dont blame my husband, I know he wronged me, and he did something horrible. I guess its just knowing who my mother is, and things shes done in her past. I guess Im just more willing to work with my husband over this than I am to work with my mother. Theyre equally to blame, but my husband is a good person, and shes not. I guess its just complicated. ",[3],[3]
10663,"Oh hell no.. You should tell them both how you feel. Youre sugar coating this & you shouldnt.

Your DH, drunk or not, still cheated. Blame both, not just your Mom. ",[1],[2]
10666,Still sugar coating the situation.,[1],[2]
10671,Why can't you talk to your husband about how you feel about the situation? Keeping it bottled up won't help anything. Also ghost your mom.,[1],[2]
10669,You need to get yourself out of the toxic situation. Neither one should be in your life. Its not right that your mom is your only friend,[1],[2]
10667,You're in denial. He's just as bad as she is. All it takes is one bad betrayal.,[1],[2]
11744,"""these idiots"" hahaha. I really do feel like I have no one to talk to most of the time because it's hard for me to open up. Thank you  I'm sure Army is difficult, we're Navy and there's so many west coast bases and that's so far!",[],[2]
11732,Are you in therapy? Because your anxiety sounds just as bad as mine was and I needed hella therapy. :(,[3],[2]
11741,"I completely agree with you, it's just hard to make the best of it when I'm in BFE, lol that's exactly how I'd describe this place. I'm trying to make a turnaround, but I see no end in sight. I want to get my license just so everyone can stop asking me when I will get it. My sister is just like me and never drives anywhere and I honestly don't want a life like that for me OR my son. Thank you for your kind words, I really appreciate it ",[2],[3]
11737,"I'm 26 so I got my permit at 24. I do try to drive to get used to it, but it hasn't helped. I've seen therapists in the past and talking about it does nothing for me, although I am on medication for depression and anxiety. Wellbutrin & Klonopin. I'm getting my Klonopin changed to 2x a day pretty soon. ",[3],[2]
11739,"Klonopin is actually the only one that works for me so far :( it's perfect for me! I just need to be on it twice a day like I have been before. It took me 3 years to get on the right cocktail of meds. I've been on Prozac, Paxil, Pristique (sp?), Buspar, and Zoloft. and none of them worked. I fought tooth and nail to get on Klonopin and had to switch my doctor on base because she told me ""we may have the wrong diagnosis"" after telling her I wanted Klonopin because it's worked before. Like you can't misdiagnose anxiety when it's so easy for me to see that it's anxiety and I've had it for years. The doctors on base are horrible. ",[3],[3]
11743,"Military life aint easy. My hubby is army and I avoid doing wife socials like the plague because I grew up around these idiots; definitely a no thank you. Sometimes having someone to talk to, military or not, is helpful. Much hugs momma. I cant promise it will get easier but hopefully you guys get somewhere that isnt so sucky. ",[2],[2]
11745,"My brother is navy after being an Army dependent for his whole life, he enjoys the work and Ive seen some of yalls bases (I went off at his school about how bullshit nice it was compared to army but I was mostly giving him a hard time cause hes my baby brother lol). Can you guys make requests as far as where you would prefer to be stationed? ",[2],[2]
11742,"My husband was Army several years ago, I remember all the struggles that went with being married to an Active Duty soldier.  I do agree with mckenmad, it is definitely what you put into it.

And I get how hard it can be to navigate through the stereotypical spouses that you frequently encounter, but I would suggest you still network and put yourself out there, and involve yourself a bit.  I have made some really incredible life long friends through family support groups, volunteer positions and those coffees that are pretty regular.  It is just a matter of weeding out the cliches to find those that you can connect with.  It's a lot of hit and miss, but it is worth it when you find that particular friend that just makes life better.",[3],[3]
11733,"No, I was going but I stopped because it was no help. Therapy helps for my depression, somewhat but not for my anxiety. My anxiety stems from nothing in particular, it's just genetic. I went to therapy for years, since I was 8 years old, off and on. I've learned the coping skills, and I've used them, but they do nothing for me when I'm in the situation that's causing me anxiety. ",[3],[2]
11735,"Thank you, and yes it does suck. I've had my permit for over 2 years, but I can't bring myself to take the driver's test. Someone will be watching me the whole time and I can't do it. Even if I get my license, I hate driving and avoid it like the plague. It's hell for me and I get so exhausted after just an hour of driving.",[2],[3]
1895,"I agree with the other poster that your compassion is admirable. When my grandparents passed, the people at their funeral home approached us a lot like it sounds like you approached people. Being treated like a person and having that human connection was invaluable during a painful time. Having people there who framed it as handling the details and helping us in our grief made all the difference. It felt like being supported, rather than it being some business transaction or something cold.",[3],[2]
1902,"I buried my Mark almost 5 years ago. Thinking you of and hoping peace finds its way to you. People often said to me in the beginning of my life without him.. I dont know how you do it. And I often thought, are there other options? You just do it.. and eventually you figure out how to go from day to day.. to actually living again. ",[3],[3]
1897,"I buried my mother a month ago, after a stroke. My whole reality shattered. There are moments when I have to remind myself to breathe and moments when I want to scream until I would get her back. There are no words for this pain and no comfort. But know that you are not alone",[3],[3]
1900,"I think that in a way, the pain of loss is a good thing. Im glad that I have felt it because it reminds me how much that person meant to me. It also helps me appreciate the others that are still here. ",[2],[2]

10155,"As much as you're painting him as a narcissist, it rubbed off on me the wrong way how it came off like you were almost *gloating* that it was you who initiated the divorce. You even flaunted pretty boldly your power in the relationship over him by saying that if you had a sudden change of mind, you knew he'd lap it up in a heartbeat. Just my 2 cents. There's 2 sides to every story and this particular one looks as if both perspectives are needed before a valid opinion can be formed.

I do hope your divorce is smooth and you guys work out an arrangement that maximizes your kid's well-being. ",[1],[3]

10140,"Reading 1,2..eek it sounded like I could've written this! I mean...the patterns are the same. Sounds like your future ex is a narcissist. Be kind to yourself and heal. You most likely are suffering from trauma. I was married to a man who felt victimized by the world and used that as an excuse to take/thieves from people. Nothing is more infuriating when you're forced in a role in marriage you didn't sign up for. I dumped my ex, got my masters, got a promotion, and travel the world. You're a good person, abused for a long time. You don't deserve that. Go and be happy. Hugs to you!",[3],[3]

I remind him that unless he wants her to hide from him he needs to be open with her. Following that he is her representative of the type of guy she will find because she sees the way he treats her mom as the standard. I try to get him to imagine her finding someone just like him, would he be happy if she found someone like him? If the answer is no he needs to change the things about himself that make him feel that way so she has a higher standard.",[3],[3]

I mean, my Yamaha is almost ten years old. Something like a new Ducati or BMW would cost an absolute fortune to repair. 

I guess part of the appeal of dirt bikes is the grittiness and dirt trail riding. It's okay if they get scratched or knocked around a bit, but a street bike belongs rubber side down.",[2],[2]
6943,"Yeah I completely agree I feel for accidents happening, shit happens,but they were the cause and you shouldn't have to worry about their possibly shoddy parts and repair schedule I would have done the same.

It's not trying to be a jerk, it's getting your stuff back to where it should be because they fucked up. I get them wanting to save money but it's simply not your fault and you shouldn't be further put out because they fucked up. Besides if they're trying to save money being biased towards themselves the work and parts will likely be inferior ",[1],[3]

 If it were a movie, there would be very short lived shots of a phone ringing, a few words spoken and the phone being loudly hung up. The car trunk would open, a few things would go in, the trunk would appear full in the next shot, and the trunk would pleasantly slam shut. Very concise. 

I hope this makes sense. It's hard to describe what made your working so enjoyable. ",[1],[2]

This is a time in a relationship to be worried- when happy days and events become like pulling teeth. Everything becomes a struggle, from getting dinner to having a drink. A guy in a happy relationship knows that passing a business card to a cute waitress under his wife's nose is a shitty move.

9778,"I think seeking a therapist would be best. It's good that you feel better, but Molly will only be a short term fix.

9781,"That's why I think a therapist would be best. They're an objective person, who've been trained to deal with stories like yours. You don't have a personal connection like with friends and family. Also you don't have to talk about anything too deep until your comfortable. Most therapist actually prefer to ease people in.

It sucks at first, realizing how selfish your partner is. To experience a betrayal like that. To realize the life you thought you had was a lie, but then you see that now you have freedom to change, to build a better life that will make you happier than your old one did. 

I hope youre able to find as much happiness as I did! ",[3],[3]

I hope you have a good support system. In case you think that's not the case, try to reach for help anyway. Sometimes there's an unexpected family member or old friend who will help you get through this. Therapy might also be a good option.

TIL it's okay to kill an animal because it's owners are bad people and you don't want to talk to them for the 2 minutes it takes to give their pet back.

The dog did nothing, it doesn't deserve the trauma of being separated from everything it knows yet again and put in a cage and potentially killed.  I'm glad OP is a better person than you.  

Go ahead and feel offended, I don't care.  What you're suggesting is horrible and incredibly, insanely selfish.

I would never forgive myself for visiting Dave's sins upon the innocent dog by giving him up to die. 

I agreed early this morning to adopt him permanently anyway so it's a non-issue. ",[3],[2]

As far as your parents go.. So they refuse to pick him up from anything but wouldn't hesitate to adopt him if you left your husband? That's pretty ridiculous and selfish on their part. You need to have a discussion with them and tell them that if they're not going to help for your sake, they should at least help for your child's sake.

This dude isn't going to change on any sort of reasonable timeline, and why should he?  From his view he has it made: rent-free with a live-in caretaker.

If you gave up on finding work without looking into welfare, subsidized daycare, etc. then you are as responsible for your situation as they are.

They couldn't get married cuz her family didn't like him. he says he's over her and does all the right things but just reading this makes me tear up and wonder if I am just the replacement.

I don't think I ll ever stop wondering if I am what he settled for and honestly, it sucks living like this. If I were your wife, I am not sure I would want to find out.

And while he hid the fact that he had feelings left over, he did also mention his wife knew they kept in contact (just not how long). And considering OP never tried to get back together with gf, it seems like a white lie to protect his wifes feelings.

Couples therapy, and work through problems together, like a marriage.",[1],[]

My son is on the spectrum, too.  He was nonverbal until he was nearly six years old.  He loved dandelions, so I got a dandelion tattoo and showed it to him.  He said ""oooh pretty!""

It was one of the first things he ever said to me unprompted and I cried my eyes out.",[3],[]

2052,"Moments like that are so awesome! My son is just finding himself verbally now and he has some really challenging behaviours, but he tried to write his name in my husband's Father's Day card. He'd been refusing to try and mark-make, so it was one of the nicest surprises. Glad you got to experience that too. I know autism is damn hard to cope with most of the time so it's really sweet when the positives do come out :)",[3],[2]
2046,"Same here, my son didn't even attempt to try to walk until he was 3 1/2. And never said anything other than a few babbles until he was 4, the first word he ever said was ""Shut up!!!"" (This was because his brothers were being loud and annoying him.) Which was followed by his brothers absolutely amazed that he even said anything distinguishable and my wife and I bawling our eyes out. It may not have been what we wanted his first word to be, but once he got his first word out his vocabulary grew exponentially. He's still got a number of issues, but we're very proud of him. Especially when he's willing to try something out of his safe zone.",[3],[]

I'm a woman, too. Women can be horribly vicious to each other and gang up and destroy the one that's different. 

Congratulations for having an opinion and standing up for it. Don't ever be forced into submission because some try to screech you into silence. The screeching isn't supportive of women, it's silencing them. We are our own worst enemy sometimes. ",[],[2]
2429,"A lot of niche groups end up being echo chambers. Over time the majority makes it so the minority (opinions) are weeded out.

But to be fair it's not unjust to assume that some of these women who are man hating, have poor behavior, or whatever are feminists, you could go on the internet and find plenty of evidence of these women claiming to be feminists and acting horribly. I get what your saying though, because that isn't what feminism is at all, and that's what sucks about anybody thinking they can claim something without upholding the values. I wouldn't say most feminists though, plenty of the ignorant spiteful girls out there as well. But then again maybe they are in the minority, they just seem more because they get the most attention, sadly",[1],[2]
2432,Its a supportive group and we give each other advice all the time. If she had posted about having a problem with her husband who was lying about what he is watching then it would be a different story.

2420,"Supporting women means also holding women accountable when they do/encourage toxic behavior, to say 'we as women can do better than this. We are better than this.'

Supporting men means also holding men accountable when they do/encourage toxic behavior, to say 'we as men can do better than this. We are better than this.'

Thank you for calling out that lady's behavior for what it is.",[1],[2]
2427,"They may not be even feminists, given that you know nothing about them, and that women-only groups exist in non-feminist and anti-feminist contexts too. Also, in general, when feminists take an interest in understanding the dynamics of consent, abuse, shaming, boundary violations, or anything else relevant to women's welfare, they develop standards in these areas about what is good and bad behavior, and hopefully apply these standards to both men and women's behavior. In other words, someone who has a principled stance against harming women in a certain way will probably know how to apply that stance to men too.

If you automatically assume that women who mistreat men are feminists, you probably don't have a good understanding of most feminists. ",[1],[2]

12208,I can assure you that you are not alone in your pain. I am seeking a divorce right now from my 9 year marriage. Your story is too eerily similar to mine. I only wish I would've left my sociopathic husband the 1st time instead of going back the 4 more times I did. The last time proved to be the most costly for me.,[3],[3]
12202,Im so sorry to hear about your coworker. I hope she can find or build a strong support system. Its so important.,[1],[2]
12203,She has one luckily. The ex is a huge jerk.,[],[2]
12200,Thank you. I appreciate your reply.,[1],[2]
12205,"Thank you. I really appreciate your openness and your offer of support!  So sorry for what youve been through, but also grateful that there is someone out there who can honestly understand what Im going through. ",[1],[2]
12198,Thank you. I really appreciate your prayers.,[1],[2]
12197,"That was tough, just by reading it I found it too muchnto handle. I want to commend your heart and your strength. You are a strong courageous woman. Thank you for sharing this. I hope and pray everything goes well with you and your divorce. You deserve to be happy. God bless you, you will be in my prayers. ",[1],[3]
12204,"Wow, this sounds chillingly like my partner's ex, and my ex (well, two of them. I was in a poly relationship with my partner and his now ex-husband, and before that I was in a 9 year relationship with a severe sociopath).  


I'm here to talk, if you need it. Even if its just to rant about the things he did or said. I'm good at listening/reading/whatever you wanna call what we do on these internets. I get you. I get you hardcore.",[3],[2]
12207,"Wow. What youre describing is what Im trying to deal with right now.  He genuinely seemed to love me. And yet he had been cheating on me throughout the marriage. I cant reconcile those two statements. I cant imagine how someone can do that and still live with himself. Pathological liarhe was and still is, which makes the process of the divorce harder still. I have to go to the city where he still lives next week on business, and have an irrational fear that Ill bump into him there. It is an instinctual fear. I hadnt really realized that. Im so sorry that happened to you, but so grateful you would share your story with me. It makes me feel less alone in my experience. ",[3],[3]
847,Hindsight is 20/20. Was still grieving the death of my last boyfriend. Made some bad decisions and put energy into an idiot who didnt return it. Lesson learned.,[2],[2]
851,I am apologizing behalf all males sorry you had to go through such a shitty experience and I really do hope you get a decent boyfriend,[1],[2]
849,"Ive really been blown away by everyone being so kind and supportive. This was the release I needed. Im usually an angry crier but here I am feeling weepy over being heard and everyone being cool as shit. From the bottom of my Texan heart, thank you. ",[2],[2]
850,"Make sure you're putting taxes away. You'll be required to withhold money from your employees earnings at a margin according to their tax threshold bracket they fall under. Just make sure when the tax man comes calling that you're good to go. 

Primary reason that new companies fail

Good work though. ",[1],[1]
844,"Oh my god, good for you!!! Im so glad you were able to get away from the negativity, thats so draining and awful. Congratulations on your thriving business, I hope it continues to succeed ",[1],[2]
852,"Success is the best revenge, no?  All of us Reddit womens are so very proud of you.  Never stop being awesome!",[1],[2]
845,Thank you very very much!,[1],[2]
853,Thank you! This made me feel great to just be heard.,[1],[2]
848,aw im sorry :( hope you find a good dude who actually deserves you,[1],[2]
846,damn thats an awesome story why would you get with a piece of shit like that in the first place,[1],[2]
6829,Amen to that,[1],[1]
6831,"I am so so sorry. I have been raped before and it was hard enough getting over that, I can't even imagine it happening three times. Just know that you are amazing and strong and that your husband loves you and that you are worth something. ",[3],[3]
6834,"I was also raped by an partner, and I know what you mean by it being the toughest. It's so much more than someone asserting their dominance and taking something physically from you, it's a break of the bond of trust that you've put in that person, of the relationship you were growing between you. 

If you ever want to talk, please send me a message. I will listen. ",[3],[2]
6830,I wish i could give you a big hug,[1],[2]
6827,I'm sorry. I wish you the best in life moving forward.,[1],[2]
6836,In my state (in the US) you can qualify for free counseling at the rape crisis center. I hope you are doing okay. I'm much older but  I am still affected by my rapes decades ago.,[2],[2]
6835,Sending you love and thanks for the awareness,[1],[2]
6833,You *are* stronger. :),[1],[2]
6825,"You're courageous and strong to share, thank you ",[1],[2]
6822,"just wanted to say i'm glad you knew not to believe/listen to those people who blamed you rather than your rapist. they are so very wrong, it's not your fault. thanks for sharing your story, you & OP are unbelievably strong <3 <3",[],[3]
9025,">	Its like (men probably get this) having 10 empty bathroom urinals and the person walking in picks the one next to you. 

And then proceeds to get backsplash all over your hands and arms.",[1],[1]
9026,And somehow Im the bad guy when I flip him off,[1],[]
9027,Be sure to send him your dry cleaning bill!,[1],[1]
9034,"Good for you! I know what its like to be non confrontational most of the time.

Last night I had a breakthrough! Haha",[2],[3]
9036,"Got all that, and photos, and was able to talk to a police report line:)

If shed rather pay for it? Fine.
Insurance? Fine.

Just show some decency!

The whole thing could have been avoided if she just parked competently. Driving skills are becoming increasingly .... nonexistent. ",[2],[3]
9030,"I'll remember this when my neighbour parks on my driveway. If I smash his car up and say it's accident, I won't have to pay!",[1],[1]
9028,"Its really too bad. Why isnt the answer oh shit, I just damaged your door. Totally my fault. Heres my number, call me with the estimate.? Is it so hard to own up to our mistakes?",[1],[2]
9033,"Ugh I know the feeling! That happened to me one time and I'm so non-confrontational, luckily my parents were there with me to back me up.
The thing was, it happened at a resturant and we werent there when the guy did it. But while talking about going inside and looking for him, he came out and tried to get in his car and drive away! His kids safety seat was on the side where my car was and he tried to sneak put his kid in from the other side to get away! We obviously stopped him and yes he did pay for the damages!",[3],[3]
9031,"Would that be worth going through insurance for, or just paying personally? (Making the payment to the shop fixing it, not the person themselves since I've seen this abused to hell)",[1],[]
9035,Wouldve also gotten her license plate number,[1],[1]
9496,"As a recovered addict, I second this",[3],[1]
9499,"I had a partner of 5 years who was a IV herioin addict. Hiding his use and his blatant lies ruined our relationship..

I struggled to end our relationship as our communication other than the lies was perfect- unlike any other person I've been with. 
Without this addiction this man would be my husband but with it his my best friend of three years post break up. 
We are both happier we took this route as we can now be honest with each other and support each other without it been too taxing. 


",[3],[3]
9495,Im sorry for you..speaking from experience : the only time a addict is lying is when they open their mouth..even a recovering one.. save your self,[2],[3]
9491,"It does sound like a separation would be the best route. If the trust is gone the relationship is doomed to fail eventually, it's better that you get out now and save yourself possibly years of more heartache.

It's possible that a separation could be the wake up call he needs to get himself back on track, in which case he could eventually work on regaining your trust. On the other hand, he might see a break up as free reign to continue his behaviour, and you would have got out early. ",[1],[3]
9497,"Keep up the good work! I was too quick to push my opinion, ",[1],[2]
9492,"Nobodys going to do drugs or be contacting dealers in my house with my sleeping babies that Im in charge of. No fucking way. And the commenters thinking you need to be more relaxed clearly dont have kids and dont realize how you shut that shit down when you are responsible for the safety and health of your kids.

You have set the ultimatum, hes clearly deep in his addiction. Somebody wont stop until they want to stop. 

You got this. For you AND your daughter.",[],[3]
9494,"Sounds like you are done. Forget what you think I you owe him and realize that if you FEEL it, trust yourself. You are probably right. Do what is best for you. I know it seems hard but focusing on you is probably something you havent done in awhile. So do that and let him sort his Shit. Leave if it causes you anxiety, cant imagine it wouldnt. That is no way to live or love. ",[1],[3]
9493,Thank you for this. I agree fully. I need to know what he's doing in my house. He has ruined his right to privacy.,[2],[2]
9498,"Thanks! And no worries, I'll be the first person to tell anyone how horribly addicts can treat the people who are trying to help them. Just glad it's something I was able to atone for",[2],[2]
9500,"The best advice someone gave me when I was leaving my ex-husband after 16 years of marriage was: ""When you make a decision, STICK TO IT."" That prevented me from going back to an abusive situation several times. Good luck. Marshall all the resources you can find to help you with your transition. Let go of guilt and take care of YOU. xoxo",[3],[3]
9200,As a black man I hope you don't resent us for the crimes of one. I truly wish you the best in recovery and trial and I also hope you haven't given up on us. Not a lot of white teachers would try to help an impoverished community. Stay strong!,[2],[3]
9191,Definitely. Court begins on 30 mins. I hope they actually get to his case today.,[1],[1]
9197,Good luck today.,[1],[2]
9194,"I hooe you cam get the parents and the girl convicted afterwards and cash in on a HEAVY money claim. Just to deter other peopke from pulling that shit.

I have once been blamed for physically abusing and raping a girl after I rejected her. Everybody that knows me knows I wouldn't hurt a fly. Literally. I shoo them out of the window. But suddenly I got a mark. Watch out for that guy, he raped somebody. NO I DIDN'T. ",[3],[2]
9192,I know I'm a little late for the post. I am pulling for you and your husband!!,[1],[2]
9190,Keep us updated please,[1],[1]
9199,See update above,[1],[1]
9193,"Thank you!! Not too late, he is still in court.",[2],[2]
9196,"There were no convictions, because our law does not depend on a jury or anything like that. It's just one (or more) judges, and as there was no proof (DNA or any tests done) there was no case. But people still look at you cross eyed afterwards. I cut all those people out of my life though. So it not does not haunt me.

Anyway, so how did it go?",[3],[3]
9195,"Yeah half of me wants to sue right back, and the other half wants to just be completely done with the whole thing.

Im so sorry that happened to you. Such an unnecessary thing to have follow you for the rest of your life, potentially. May the truth come out!",[],[3]
12257,"Do not reach out to him.

By saying what you did, you have probably made sure that he is going to stay away from you for the foreseeable future, which is a huge win. There is no upside to having him be a part of your life.

It's understandable that you feel bad about your comment, but his wife probably didn't even hear it, and in any case you're not making anything better by reaching out to either of them. Turn your guilty conscience into an effort to be more kind to the next person you meet instead.",[1],[3]
12246,"I actually laughed a little bit. Yes, it was mean and spiteful, but you didn't do it to hurt his wife but as a way to get back at him for abusing you, which is understandable. And from his reaction looks like it worked. 

It's good that you feel bad about it, but don't punish yourself further - learn from it and move on. ",[1],[2]
12252,"I don't agree with the other commenters who say that the guy deserved it, etc. You didn't attack the guy, you attacked his wife. He may have gone home and been abusive toward her because of that. I wouldn't reach out to him, no good can come of that, but I'm glad that you realize it was shitty. Just learn from the experience and do better in the future.",[1],[2]
12256,I would've done the same thing lmao,[1],[2]
12253,"If that's all it takes for him to abuse his wife, he was messed up to begin with and that would not be Op's fault. ",[1],[2]
12251,It happens to the best of us and I am sure you meant no harm and he is/was a dick to you. Don't worry about it.,[1],[2]
12255,It's not like she planned it. Things will always slip out.,[1],[2]
12254,Oh 100% he's messed up and it's not OPs fault for any of his behavior. But adding fuel to someone who is known to be volatile isn't something to encourage.,[1],[2]
12259,"When they go low, you go high. What would you want done if the tables were reversed? ",[1],[2]
12258,"haha! the universe bent the space-time continuum to get you the chance to get back at him!!

no need to feel bad. it's good life experience for him.",[1],[2]
5719,"Exactly a year ago my husband left me. He was the one in your position and it completely blindsided me. He said he could see i wasnt happy but I loved him dearly. A year down the line and weve both been through a lot. Therapy and talking and being open and honest and we are happier than we have ever been. We needed that time apart to focus on our own things and we both knew we loved each other and wanted to work on it. I know not all stories are like this, but I just wanted you to have some hope that things do sometimes work and get better. Hang in there and just focus on you for a while. Sending you love. ",[3],[2]
5715,"Hey man, you're acknowledging your fault and actively trying to improve yourself. Congrats, you're doing better than most of humanity. 

But for real, seeing faults in ones own personality is fucking hard. I'm not saying these problems are on your wife's shoulders, but if she was struggling for so long she should have communicated it a lot sooner. You can't fix a problem you aren't aware of, and now that you see it you are doing something about it. I really hope your wife recognizes that and works through these issues with you. You guys are in a partnership, for better or worse, so this issue is for both of you to solve. Keep improving yourself, loving your wife, and I really hope things work out for the best, pal. ",[],[3]
5710,I know its hard to accept who you have been for such a long time and try to change it. Thats hard and it takes time. We are here for you. Im sorry to hear this has happened for both you and her.,[1],[2]
5713,I really hope you both make it - sometimes you dont realise your errors until you reflect on them - but the fact shes willing to go to therapy and youre seeking to change show great signs of willing to better yourself for your marriage,[],[2]
5711,"It doesn't sound like divorce has happened yet. This was a lot of the problems in my last serious relationship. He was controlling, he was overbearing, and he was overprotective. His problem was that he wouldn't admit fault no matter what.

The counseling will help, your personal counseling will help, if you truely wish to change for the better and yourself.

Perhaps, as things hopefully improve, there can be a code word she can use to help you and her recognize when it's happening.

Stay strong, have an open mind, and listen to her/your counselor very carefully. ",[3],[]
5716,"Its amazing that youre accepting your responsibility for the breakdown of your marriage. 

Going to therapy and bettering yourself will set you up for success. I would say though that you can talk to your wife and ask if she is willing to give it another shot, but she has every right to say no. 

My ex went absolutely batshit when he promised to go to therapy and make big changes and I was past the point of wanted to work it out. Honestly, I wasnt trying to be cruel but five+ years of pain killed any love I might have had. (Spoiler alert: two years on, he has not made positive changes, he just wanted me to keep putting up with his garbage.) ",[2],[2]
5717,Ive never seen anyone in a position like this actually acknowledge what they did wrong and actually feel sorry and try to change. This was refreshing to read. I hope everything works out for the best with you two.,[],[2]
5714,"Just read this on an advice thread that Dads give to their sons. You fucked up, but youre not fucked up. Time to move past it and forgive yourself dont be too hard on yourself my man. ",[1],[2]
5712,"My ex of 20 years was like you. Unlike you, he wanted to control me in every way he could. He needed to know my every move, wanted to know where I spent my money, whom I was with, where I was... His jealousy was atrophying our relationship.

Unlike you, he never saw the error of his ways, and we have been separated for 2.5 years. I commend you for recognizing the problem and working towards it. It's not easy to see one's own faults. 

Best of luck to you.",[2],[2]
5718,Youll be ok buddy. Youre on the right path to mend things. Good luck.,[1],[2]
